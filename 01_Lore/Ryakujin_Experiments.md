## BAKUZOKU (爆属)

### **NAME MEANING**
- **爆** (Baku) = Explosion, Bomb
- **属** (Zoku) = Clan, Tribe, Attribute
- Translation: "Explosion Clan" or "Bomb Tribe"

---

### **DEFINITION**

**What They Are:**
Experimental humans created by the Ryakujin as biological weapons. Bakuzoku appear physically human but lack full consciousness, functioning more like intelligent animals than sentient beings.

**Classification:**
- Originally artificially created (not naturally occurring)
- Capable of reproduction among themselves
- Offspring inherit Bakuzoku traits (becomes self-sustaining population)

**Population Status (Arc 2):**
- **Extinct** (exterminated ~19 years before Arc 2)
- **Only known survivor:** Lyon de Sores (half-Bakuzoku hybrid)

---

### **CHARACTERISTICS**

#### **Physical Appearance**
- **Indistinguishable from normal humans**
- No distinctive physical traits or markers
- Can wear clothing and form societies (mimicking human behavior)

#### **Mental/Behavioral Traits**
- **Lack consciousness** in most cases (animal-level intelligence)
- **Cannot speak human languages** (communicate through their own guttural language)
- **Live like wild animals** despite human-like appearance
- **Lack emotions** (most individuals show no emotional responses)
- Form tribal societies but operate on instinct rather than reason

#### **Exceptions**
- Rare genetic variations can produce conscious individuals
- **Nantes de Sores:** Only known fully conscious Bakuzoku
  - Developed speech through interaction with Marsella
  - Formed genuine emotional bonds (romantic relationship)
  - Proved consciousness was possible in Bakuzoku genetics

---

### **ABILITIES**

#### **Primary Power: Bomb Generation**

**Nouryoku (能力):**
- **Universal ability:** ALL Bakuzoku possess the same power
- **Function:** Generate bombs in their hands
- **Activation:** Can throw and remotely detonate the bombs
- **Immunity:** Bakuzoku are immune to their own explosions
  - Bombs do not harm the Bakuzoku who created them
  - Can create explosions at point-blank range safely

**Limitations:**
- [Range of bomb throwing TBD]
- [Size/power of bombs TBD]
- [Number of bombs that can be generated simultaneously TBD]

---

#### **Kyousen (狂戦) - Berserk State**

**Name Meaning:**
- **狂** (Kyou) = Madness, Insanity
- **戦** (Sen) = War, Battle
- Translation: "Mad War" or "Berserk Combat"

**What It Is:**
A phenomenon unique to Bakuzoku where they lose all control and enter a violent frenzy.

**Symptoms:**
- **Complete loss of sanity/control**
- Indiscriminate bomb throwing in all directions
- No awareness of allies, enemies, or environment
- **Cannot be stopped or reasoned with** during episode
- No memory of actions after Kyousen ends (presumed)

**Triggers:**
- **Spontaneous onset** - can enter Kyousen suddenly without warning
- Specific triggers unknown (stress? Instinct? Random?)
- Unpredictable and uncontrollable

**Why It Made Them a Failed Experiment:**
- Kyousen made Bakuzoku unreliable as weapons
- Could turn on their creators or allies without warning
- Environmental destruction made them dangerous to deploy
- Combined with lack of speech/consciousness, Ryakujin deemed them failures

---

### **HISTORY**

#### **Creation**

**When:**
- Created **many years before Kami** was made
- Predates the Ryakujin's Kamino-area operations
- Exact timeline: [Decades? Centuries? TBD]

**Where:**
- Created in Ryakujin facility near what would become **Jitsumoto territory**
- Different location from where Kami was later created (near Kamino)
- Northern region facility

**How:**
- Scientific process (genetic engineering, biological manipulation)
- Designed to be mass-producible biological weapons
- Intended to have uniform abilities (bomb generation)

**Purpose:**
- Living weapons for Ryakujin use
- Expendable soldiers with destructive power
- Meant to be controlled and deployed strategically

---

#### **Abandonment**

**Why They Were Abandoned:**
1. **Failed to develop speech** - couldn't follow complex orders
2. **Lack of consciousness** - unreliable and unpredictable
3. **Kyousen phenomenon** - made them too dangerous to control
4. Overall deemed a **failed experiment**

**What Happened:**
- Ryakujin released Bakuzoku into the wild (nature)
- Left them to survive on their own
- Moved operations elsewhere (eventually near Kamino for Kami's creation)

**Bakuzoku After Abandonment:**
- **Reproduced among themselves**
- Formed a **self-sustaining community**
- Lived as a wild tribe in the northern region (future Jitsumoto territory)
- **Avoided by local populations** (feared as dangerous)
- Existed in isolation for many years

---

#### **The Extermination (~19 Years Before Arc 2)**

**Context:**
- Shigeru Houzu (former Pristania 4 Emperor) founded Jitsumoto
- Chose the northern territory for his organization's base
- Territory was unclaimed because locals feared the Bakuzoku

**Shigeru's Decision:**
- Realized Bakuzoku posed a threat:
  - **Kyousen incidents** caused unpredictable violence
  - **Environmental destruction** from constant explosions
  - Dangerous to Jitsumoto members and operations
- **Ordered complete extermination** of all Bakuzoku
- Operation conducted in secret (even his wife and daughter didn't know)

**Timeline:**
- **~21 years before Arc 2:** Yonoa (age 12) sent to Vista Alegre to study
- **~19 years before Arc 2:** Extermination ordered (Yonoa age 14, studying away)
- Yonoa's mother also unaware (remained ignorant until Arc 5)
- **Total secrecy maintained** - existence of Bakuzoku erased

**Execution:**
- Jitsumoto operatives systematically hunted down Bakuzoku
- Entire population eliminated
- Bodies presumably disposed of to hide evidence
- Local rumors suppressed or forgotten over time

**Result:**
- Bakuzoku effectively **extinct**
- Territory secured for Jitsumoto expansion
- Only survivor: **Lyon de Sores** (unbeknownst to Shigeru)

---

### **THE TRAGEDY OF MARSELLA DE SORES**

**[MAJOR STORY SPOILERS BELOW - Arc 2, Arc 5]**

---

#### **Marsella & Nantes**

**Marsella de Sores:**
- Scientist living in the region (near future Jitsumoto territory)
- Researching Bakuzoku behavior and intelligence
- [Age at time TBD]

**Nantes de Sores:**
- Genetically exceptional Bakuzoku (rare conscious individual)
- Somehow different from his kind (genetic luck/mutation)
- Did not develop consciousness from birth but had potential

**Their Meeting (~21 years before Arc 2):**
- Marsella woke up one day to find Nantes in her house
- **Nantes did NOT attack her** (unprecedented Bakuzoku behavior)
- Formed a bond (similar to Tarzan and Jane dynamic)
- Marsella taught Nantes to speak (limited but functional)
- Relationship grew from curiosity → friendship → romance
- Nantes took the surname "de Sores" (bonded as family)

**Marsella's Research:**
- Used Nantes as proof that Bakuzoku could develop consciousness
- Investigated whether other Bakuzoku had similar potential
- Hoped to awaken intelligence in the species
- Research cut short by the extermination

---

#### **Lyon's Birth (~20 years before Arc 2)**

**Conception:**
- Marsella and Nantes had a child together
- **Lyon de Sores:** Human-Bakuzoku hybrid
- Born approximately 1 year before the extermination

**Phase 5 - The Truth:**
- Dying operative confesses:
  - "By order of Shigeru, leader of Jitsumoto..."
  - "...all Bakuzoku must be eliminated"
  - "We heard a Bakuzoku hypnotized you and fathered a child"
- **Marsella finishes him** (rage and grief)

- No identification, no explanation
- Assume Lyon is an abandoned human child
- **Do NOT know he is Bakuzoku** (appears fully human)

**Adoption:**
- **Tairin (Delara Centerox)** takes Lyon in

- Lyon grows up believing he's an orphan
- No knowledge of his Bakuzoku heritage

**Lyon's Kyousen:**
- Manifests as he grows older (inherited trait)
- Free witnesses episodes but doesn't understand
- **Misdiagnosed as a "disease" or medical condition**
- Free has no knowledge of Bakuzoku (extinct, erased from history)
- Lyon himself doesn't understand what happens to him

---

#### **Marsella's Infiltration of Jitsumoto**

**The Plan:**
- Marsella decides to destroy Jitsumoto from within
- Revenge against Shigeru for ordering the extermination
- Long-term infiltration strategy

**Joining Jitsumoto (~After extermination):**
- Presents herself as a scientist seeking to join
- **Hides her connection to Nantes and Lyon** (Shigeru doesn't know)
- Uses her genuine scientific skills to prove her worth
- Gradually earns trust and rises through ranks
- Eventually appointed **Imperial Scientist** (highest scientific position)

**Double Agent - Alliance with Pristania:**

**Why Pristania:**
- Diominiciel and Perlereina **despise Shigeru**
  - He remained neutral during the 3-Year War
  - They consider him a traitor for not supporting Pristania
  - Seeking allies against Jitsumoto
- Marsella sees opportunity for revenge

**The Offer:**
- Marsella approaches Diominiciel and Perlereina
- Offers her services as **spy within Jitsumoto**
- Provides intelligence on Shigeru's operations
- **They accept** (mutual benefit)

**Marsella's True Loyalty:**

---

#### **The Incident 5 Years Before Arc 2**

**Marsella's Orchestration:**
- Now established as Imperial Scientist in Jitsumoto
- Also working as Pristania agent
- **Engineers an attack:** Pristania strikes Free's previous headquarters
- Provides intelligence to make the attack possible
- Goal: Harm Free, destabilize peace, advance Pristania's goals

**The Attack:**
- Pristania assaults Free's base (location before the island)
- **Free is forced to relocate** → moves to the island (current HQ location)
- Significant casualties and chaos

**Marsella's Discovery:**
- During the attack, Marsella is present (observing or participating somehow)
- **Sees Lyon** among Free's defenders
- Recognizes him instantly (mother's intuition + he resembles Nantes)
- **Realizes Lyon is alive** for the first time in 14+ years
- Realizes her son grew up in Free, the organization she helped attack
- Internal conflict: Revenge vs. maternal love

**Aftermath:**
- Marsella now knows Lyon lives
- Lyon does NOT know his mother is alive or that he saw her
- Marsella continues her infiltration, now with more complicated motivations

---

**END OF BAKUZOKU ENTRY**

## KIRYUUIN (鬼龍院)

### **NAME MEANING**
- **鬼** (Ki) = Demon, Oni
- **龍** (Ryuu) = Dragon
- **院** (In) = Institute, Temple, Mansion, Noble House
- Translation: "Demon Dragon House/Institute" - Suggests both power and darkness

---

### **DEFINITION**

**What They Are:**
An ancient bloodline of assassins descended from Ryakujin experiments conducted centuries ago. Originally created as perfect soldiers, the Kiryuuin were abandoned and formed their own family dynasty. Over generations, their Ryakujin origins were forgotten or deliberately concealed, and they became a legendary assassin clan.

**Classification:**
- Originally artificially created (Ryakujin experiment)
- Now a self-perpetuating family lineage through reproduction
- Descendants inherit Kiryuuin traits and abilities
- Ancient bloodline (centuries old)

**Population Status (Arc 2):**
- **Nearly extinct** - only 3 living members remain
- Centuries of internal conflict and assassination reduced their numbers
- Family destroyed from within by their own traditions

**Current Members:**
1. **Goro Kiryuuin (鬼龍院伍郎)** - Father, family head, ~50-55 years old
2. **Shiro Kiryuuin (鬼龍院四郎)** - Elder son, ~32 years old (officially "dead", actually alive as Takumi Reiji/Zafiro)
3. **Ichiro Kiryuuin (鬼龍院一朗)** - Younger son, ~17 years old (member of Free, protagonist)

---

### **CHARACTERISTICS**

#### **Physical Appearance**
- **Indistinguishable from normal humans**
- No distinctive physical markers that identify them as Kiryuuin
- Appear completely human

#### **Mental/Behavioral Traits**
- **Fully conscious and intelligent** (unlike Bakuzoku)
- Can speak, reason, and function normally in society
- Raised from birth in assassin training
- Strict, disciplined upbringing focused on killing arts
- Complicated family dynamics due to traditions

#### **Cultural Identity**
- **Naming convention:** All male Kiryuuin names end in **-rou (郎, 朗, etc.)**
  - Examples: Go**rou**, Shi**rou**, Ichi**rou**
  - Traditional Japanese naming pattern
  - Identifies them within the family lineage

---

### **ABILITIES**

#### **Nouryoku (能力)**

**NOT Universal:**
- Unlike Bakuzoku (who all share bomb generation), each Kiryuuin has a **unique Nouryoku**
- Powers are individual, not standardized
- Inherited genetically but manifest differently per person
- Specific powers: [See individual character profiles]

**What IS Universal:**
- **ALL Kiryuuin possess Nouryoku** (100% rate, unlike general population)
- ALL Kiryuuin powers can **evolve** to a higher level
- Evolution mechanism is unique to Kiryuuin bloodline

---

#### **Power Evolution - The Kiryuuin Curse**

**True Mechanism (Unknown to the Family):**

When a Kiryuuin is **at the brink of death**, their body releases a special energy.

**Activation Conditions:**
- Must be **near death** (life-threatening injury, critical state)
- Applies to the Kiryuuin themselves OR other Kiryuuin nearby
- **Range:** Within 2 meters of the dying/nearly-dying Kiryuuin

**Effect:**
- Released energy triggers **permanent evolution** of Nouryoku
- Works on the dying Kiryuuin themselves (if they survive)
- Works on other Kiryuuin within 2-meter radius
- **Evolution is permanent** - power remains at new level forever
- **Can only evolve once** - not multiple levels (base → evolved, that's it)

**Example Scenarios:**

1. **Self-Evolution:**
   - Kiryuuin is mortally wounded in battle
   - Hovers at brink of death but recovers
   - Their own power evolves during near-death state
   - Awakens with permanently evolved Nouryoku

2. **Proximity Evolution:**
   - Kiryuuin A is dying
   - Kiryuuin B and C are within 2 meters
   - All three evolve (including A if they survive)
   - Energy release affects all nearby Kiryuuin simultaneously

3. **Intentional Triggering:**
   - Kiryuuin brings themselves to brink of death deliberately
   - Triggers evolution in nearby family members
   - Dangerous but possible method

**Critical Truth:**
**The dying Kiryuuin does NOT need to actually die. They only need to reach the brink of death to trigger the energy release.**

---

#### **The Family's Fatal Misunderstanding**

**What the Kiryuuin Believe (INCORRECT):**
To evolve their Nouryoku, they must **kill a member of their own family**.

**How the Misunderstanding Began:**
- Centuries ago, during a family dispute
- One Kiryuuin killed another in combat
- Killer's power evolved (victim was at brink of death before dying, released energy)
- Family concluded: "Murder = Evolution"
- Tradition solidified over generations
- **Truth was never discovered** - pattern seemed consistent because killing DOES bring someone to brink of death

**Why It Persists:**
- When you kill someone, they ARE at brink of death (releases energy)
- Killer evolves → reinforces belief
- Family never tested non-lethal alternatives
- Became sacred tradition, never questioned
- **No living Kiryuuin knows the truth** (as of Arc 2 start)

**The Tragedy:**
The Kiryuuin have been **murdering each other for centuries based on a lie**. They could evolve by simply bringing each other near death and healing them, but instead they commit familicide believing it's necessary.

---

#### **Power Evolution - Current Status**

**Goro Kiryuuin:**
- **Has evolved** - killed his own father to trigger evolution
- Committed patricide believing it was necessary tradition
- Lives with this act as part of family legacy

**Shiro Kiryuuin:**
- **Has evolved** - brought to brink of death and survived (details TBD in character profile)
- **Did NOT kill anyone** to achieve evolution
- Evolution occurred through actual mechanism (near-death experience)
- Does not fully understand how it happened (begins forming theories)

**Ichiro Kiryuuin:**
- **Evolution status:** [SPOILER - TBD in story]

---

### **FAMILY TRADITIONS & CULTURE**

#### **The Assassin Legacy**

**Profession:**
- **All Kiryuuin must be assassins** (family law)
- Trained from childhood in killing arts
- Expected to take contracts and execute targets
- Professional reputation built over centuries

**Why Assassination?**
- Originally needed funds to survive after Ryakujin abandonment
- Killing skills from soldier training translated to mercenary work
- Murder-for-evolution tradition normalized violence
- Became family identity over generations

**Training:**
- Begins in early childhood
- Harsh, strict discipline
- No room for weakness or sentiment
- Focused on combat, stealth, poison, tactics
- **Children who refuse** are seen as failures/disgraces

---

#### **Purity Obsession**

**Bloodline Fanaticism:**
- Obsessed with maintaining pure Kiryuuin genetics
- Believe only Kiryuuin blood carries the evolution trait
- **Refuse to allow outsiders into the family**

**Reproduction Method:**
- Kiryuuin have children with **non-Kiryuuin partners** (genetic diversity)
- **Steal the baby** immediately after birth
- Disappear without trace, leaving the non-Kiryuuin parent behind
- **No mothers or fathers** allowed in family (only Kiryuuin blood)

**Result:**
- Every Kiryuuin child raised by **only one parent** (the Kiryuuin parent)
- Never meet their non-Kiryuuin parent
- Grow up knowing they were "stolen" for the bloodline
- Creates broken family dynamics

**Goro's Children:**
- **Shiro:** Different mother, stolen at birth
- **Ichiro:** Different mother, stolen at birth
- Brothers never knew each other's mothers
- Raised separately (Shiro left before Ichiro was old enough to remember him)

---

#### **Evolution Tradition (Based on Misunderstanding)**

**The "Rule":**
- To evolve your Nouryoku, you must kill a family member
- **NOT mandatory** - Kiryuuin can choose not to seek evolution
- But it's a **revered tradition** - those who evolve gain prestige
- Family expects members to eventually do it

**How It Works in Practice:**
- **No formal rules** on who, when, or how
- Each Kiryuuin plans their own "sacrifice"
- Can target: father, sibling, grandparent, cousin - any blood relative
- Method is personal choice (duel, assassination, ambush)
- **Availability matters** - kill who you can access

**Goro's Example:**
- Killed his own father to evolve
- This is seen as **normal and honorable** in family context
- Father likely expected it (part of tradition)

**Family Attitude:**
- **Accepted reality** - "One day, one of my children will kill me"
- Doesn't eliminate love or coexistence, but colors all relationships
- Creates paranoia and tension
- Some family members are close despite this, others distant

**Why Some Leave:**
- Children like Shiro and Ichiro refuse to become assassins
- Refuse to participate in murder-for-evolution
- Seen as weak or traitorous by family
- Flee rather than conform

---

#### **Family Dynamics**

**Relationships:**
- **Complicated and strained** by tradition
- Love exists but is overshadowed by survival instinct
- Hard, strict upbringing (no softness tolerated)
- Training begins young (childhood stolen by assassin education)

**Goro as Father:**
- Has **father issues** (details TBD in story)
- Loves his sons but raised them harshly
- Knows they may kill him one day (accepts this)
- Lost both sons to desertion (both fled family)

**Between Siblings:**
- **Shiro and Ichiro never knew each other**
- 14-year age gap + Shiro left when Ichiro was ~2 years old
- No childhood memories together
- Ichiro doesn't know Shiro exists (believes he's an only child or Shiro is dead)
- **Shiro knows about Ichiro** (learned somehow after leaving - details TBD)

---

#### **No Written Laws, But Rigid Traditions**

**Family History:**
- Oral traditions passed down generations
- Stories of past Kiryuuin and their deeds
- Legends of famous assassinations
- Tales of evolution sacrifices

**No Codified Rules:**
- When to kill for evolution: Personal choice
- Who to kill: Whoever is available
- How to kill: Any method works
- Leaving the family: Technically possible, seen as betrayal

---

### **HISTORY**

#### **Creation (Centuries Ago)**

**When:**
- Created by Ryakujin **centuries before Kami**
- Exact timeline unclear (100+ years? 500+?)
- Predates all modern events by vast margin
- Ancient experiment from early Ryakujin era

**Where:**
- Ryakujin facility location unknown
- Different from Bakuzoku creation site
- Different from Kami creation site (Kamino area)

**How:**
- Scientific process (genetic engineering/biological manipulation)
- Designed as **perfect soldiers**
- Combat-focused abilities
- Enhanced physical and mental traits

**Purpose:**
- Military weapons for Ryakujin use
- Elite strike force
- Expendable but highly effective troops

---

#### **Abandonment**

**Why They Were Abandoned:**
- **Successful but obsolete** - Ryakujin moved on to other projects
- No longer needed for whatever war/conflict they were created for
- Perhaps deemed too independent or dangerous
- Ryakujin priorities shifted

**What Happened:**
- Released into the world to fend for themselves
- Retained combat skills and abilities
- Retained consciousness and intelligence (unlike Bakuzoku)
- **Deliberately concealed their Ryakujin origins**
  - First generation wanted to erase shameful past
  - Destroyed records or hid them
  - Told descendants they were a "natural" ancient family

**[SPOILER - Timing TBD]:**

- Only need to bring Kiryuuin to brink of death (can survive)
- **Centuries of murder were unnecessary**

**Who Discovers It:**

### **RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER EXPERIMENTS**

**Compared to Bakuzoku:**
- **Both created by Ryakujin** as weapons
- **Both abandoned** when deemed obsolete/failed
- **Both formed self-sustaining populations** through reproduction
- **Key difference:** Kiryuuin retained intelligence and integrated into society; Bakuzoku remained animalistic and were exterminated

**Compared to Kami/Meiji/Rajin (God-Tier Beings):**
- Kiryuuin are **much older** (centuries vs. decades)
- Kiryuuin are **reproducible** (have children); God-tiers are unique individuals
- Kiryuuin were **forgotten successes**; God-tiers are **known failures/escapes**
- Power scale: God-tiers >>> Kiryuuin (evolved Kiryuuin still not god-tier)

---

### **THEMATIC SIGNIFICANCE**

**The Kiryuuin Represent:**
- **Generational trauma** - cycles of violence passed down
- **Misunderstood legacy** - traditions based on false assumptions
- **Self-destruction** - family destroyed by its own beliefs
- **The cost of secrets** - hiding Ryakujin origin led to misunderstanding evolution
- **Redemption possibilities** - Goro's arc, Shiro/Ichiro's choices

**Key Questions Raised:**
- Can you escape your family's sins? (Shiro and Ichiro trying)
- Is tradition sacred if it's based on lies? (Evolution murder myth)
- Can a family heal after centuries of trauma? (Only 3 left, can they reconcile?)
- What do you owe your bloodline vs. yourself? (Assassin duty vs. personal morality)

---
