## TIMELINE

### **THE ANCIENT ERA - THE RYAKUJIN PROJECT**

**Year 0 (Reference Point):**
- The **Ryakujin** (ancient hidden civilization) conduct experiments to create god-tier beings
- Three prototypes are developed in a secret laboratory:
  - **Zenshin (善神)** - Codename: **Magnus Dei** - "The Positive God"
  - **Jashin (邪神)** - Codename: **Opus Dei** - "The Negative God"  
  - **Megami (女神)** - Codename: **Mei Dei** - "The Neutral Force"
- Design philosophy: Positive and negative forces clash → powers grow through conflict
- Megami serves as mediator/balance between the two

**The Betrayal:**
- The three develop emotional bonds despite being experiments
- Romantic tension develops between **Jashin** and **Megami**
- **Zenshin** becomes jealous
- Chief scientist **Hide** manipulates Zenshin, promises to eliminate Jashin

**The Three Cities Test:**
The Ryakujin send all three to different human cities to test their combat effectiveness.

**Jashin's Test:**
- Kills a target gleefully when ordered
- Is ambushed by Ryakujin agents (hired by Hide to assassinate him)
- Kills the agents in self-defense
- Feels betrayed, destroys the entire city in rage
- Returns to facility, begins massacring scientists

**Megami's Test:**
- Ordered to kill, but **cannot** (pacifism hardcoded into her power)
- Ryakujin deem her a **failure**, abandon her to city authorities
- Zenshin arrives to save her
- Is **shot in the head by police**, dies
- Zenshin destroys the city in grief, carries her body back to facility

**Zenshin's Test:**
- Refuses orders, destroys transmission device
- Rushes to save Megami (arrives too late)

**The Facility Confrontation:**
- Zenshin arrives to find Jashin has already slaughtered most scientists
- Jashin is currently killing Hide
- Zenshin reveals Megami's death
- **Hide confesses:** He and Zenshin conspired to kill Jashin
- The two brothers clash over Megami's corpse
- Zenshin is losing badly

**The Sealing:**
- Hide reveals a technique to **seal Jashin's consciousness** using Zenshin's power
- Zenshin seals Jashin, putting him in a **coma**
- Seal functions: As long as Zenshin's power exists, Jashin remains sealed

**Hide's Final Manipulation:**
- Reveals the **Resurrection Ability** (both brothers possess it)
- **THE LIE:** "You can revive the dead twice, after which you will cease to exist"
- **THE TRUTH:** After two resurrections, the **power** ceases to exist (user survives but becomes powerless)
- Hide suggests: "Revive me, we'll make more Megamis, call the experiment a success"
- Zenshin **kills Hide** in fury

**The Choice:**
- Zenshin uses his **first resurrection** on Megami
- **Lies to her:** "The Ryakujin killed Jashin, we both destroyed the facility together"
- They bury Jashin's **still-living comatose body**
- Escape together

- Have three children (the **Kamigami** - 神々):

---

### **THE DUEL ERA**

**15 Years After Megami's Departure:**

**Meiji at Age 16:**
- Founds the organization **Free** (opposes Pristania ideologically)
- **Publicly challenges Kami to a duel** during a speech
- Ideological basis: Humans should have free will to choose morality, not be forced into it

**The Kamigami's Ages:**
- Diominiciel: ~22 years old
- Hirohiko: ~20 years old (has recruited his Apostle **Gallan Byronstrike**)
- Perlereina: ~17 years old

**The Duel:**
- **Location:** Stadium, public to faction members (Pristania, Free, Jitsumoto), hidden from civilians
- **Opening:** Kami dominates (veteran experience)
- **Turning Point:** Meiji's **Ryakujin contingency activates** (hidden programming triggers when fighting god-tier powers)
  - Massive strength/speed boost
  - Possible semi-transformation
  - Meiji attributes this to adrenaline, doesn't know he's a weapon
- **Reversal:** Meiji gains the upper hand
- **Climax:** Kami grows desperate, fights "ruthlessly" (loses composure, becomes savage)
- **Outcome:** Kami dies in the final clash

**Immediate Aftermath:**
- **Kami's power fragments:**
  - 30% → **Arjan** (positive reincarnation)
  - 30% → **Lopney** (negative reincarnation)
  - 40% → Remains in Kami's corpse (can be absorbed)
- **The Kamigami take Kami's corpse**, hide it (only they know it exists)
- **Jashin's status changes:**
  - Seal does NOT fully break (Kami's power still exists in fragments)
  - Jashin gains **limited consciousness** (can manifest around his comatose body)
  - Physical body remains comatose in Pristania's secret chamber
  - Only Kami and Rajin knew of his location

**Rajin's Reaction:**
- Feels sudden **grief** (the emptiness after revenge)
- Mourns for the Kamigami (her abandoned children, now fatherless)
- Remains in Free but doesn't actively participate in the war
- Becomes a wandering figure (physically present, emotionally absent)

---

### **THE WAR ERA**

**3-Year War (Pristania vs. Free):**

**Pristania's Side:**
- Led by the **Kamigami** (fueled by vengeance)
- Brutal tactics (righteousness twisted into retribution)
- Gallan serves as Hirohiko's Apostle, participates in combat

**Free's Side:**
- Led by **Meiji** (ages 16-19 during war)
- Equally ruthless (survival + ideological victory)

**The Atrocities:**
- Massive casualties on both sides
- Civilians caught in crossfire
- Former allies killing each other
- Gallan witnesses comrades die, kills in Kami's name
- Realizes: "This is not what Kami would have wanted"

**The Treaty:**
- **War-weary faction emerges:**
  - Hirohiko (realizes vengeance perverts his father's legacy)
  - Rajin (guilt-ridden, sees the cycle repeating)
  - Gallan (horrified by what he's become)
  - Others from both sides
- Treaty signed after 3 years
- Ends active conflict, establishes fragile peace

**Gallan's Defection:**
- Waits until treaty is signed
- Disappears to an isolated island to redeem himself
- Shortly after arrival, discovers **two babies in a cave**

- Combat philosophy: **Skill + strategy > raw power**

**Naming Convention:**
- Characters have **true names** + **nicknames** based on their abilities or reputation
- Trend started by Magnus Dei, Opus Dei, Mei Dei

---

---

---

### **REINCARNATION MECHANIC**

**When a god-tier user dies:**

1. Their power **fragments into 3 parts:**
   - **30%** → "Positive" reincarnation
   - **30%** → "Negative" reincarnation  
   - **40%** → Remains in the user's corpse (can be absorbed by others)

2. **After 2 resurrections:** Power is permanently destroyed (no reincarnation possible)

**Kami's Death:**
- 30% → **Arjan** (positive fragment, exhibits Kami-like traits)
- 30% → **Lopney** (negative fragment, different tendencies)
- 40% → **Kami's corpse** (guarded by the Kamigami, location secret)

**Implication:**
- Arjan and Lopney can eventually **inherit Kami's four abilities**
- Method of inheritance: *[To be revealed in story]*
- They are unaware of their true nature

---

### **SEALING MECHANIC**

**Jashin's Seal:**
- Created using Zenshin's power
- **Function:** Seals Jashin's consciousness, puts body in coma
- **Duration:** As long as the sealing power exists
- **Break conditions:**
  - If Kami used his 2nd resurrection (loses power) → seal breaks
  - If Kami's power is completely destroyed → seal breaks
  - Currently: Power exists in fragments (Arjan/Lopney/corpse) → seal holds, but Jashin gains limited awareness

### **FREE**

**Founder:** Meiji  
**Ideology:** Humans must have free will to choose morality (not be forced)  
**Core Belief:** Pristania's authoritarian morality is tyranny disguised as righteousness

**Current Leadership:**
- Meiji (founder, age 34 during Arc 1)

**Key Members:**
- **Rajin (Megami in disguise):** Meiji's adoptive mother, wandering member
- **Kensuke:** Ex-Pristania Emperor, Rajin's husband, senior member

**Post-War Status:**
- Signed treaty to end 3-Year War
- Cold war tension with Pristania
- Achieved ideological victory (proved Kami's system could be challenged)

**Philosophy in Practice:**
- Allows members freedom to interpret morality
- Does this lead to internal conflict? Chaos? Or functional diversity?
- *[Further details TBD]*

---

### **JITSUMOTO**

**Status:** Third major faction  
**Role in Duel:** Witnessed the event (invited observers)  
**Role in War:** *[TBD - neutral? Allied with one side? Isolationist?]*

**Ideology:** *[UNDEFINED - needs development]*
- If Pristania = Order and Free = Freedom, what does Jitsumoto represent?
- Possible directions: Pragmatism? Balance? Isolationism? Tradition?

**This faction needs significant development.**

---

### **THE RYAKUJIN**

**Nature:** Ancient, technologically advanced civilization  
**Status:** Hidden from modern humanity  
**Goal:** Create beings capable of achieving godhood

**Known Projects:**
- Zenshin/Kami (successful, exceeded expectations, betrayed them)
- Jashin (successful, exceeded expectations, betrayed them)
- Megami (deemed a failure, abandoned)
- Meiji (contingency weapon, still in development during facility massacre)

**Current Status:**
- Unknown (do they still exist? Are they monitoring the world? Did the facility massacre end them?)
- *[Needs development for potential late-story reveals]*

---

#### **JITSUMOTO**

**This faction needs complete development:**
- What is their ideology?
- Where are they based?
- Who leads them?
- What role do they play in Arcs 1-6?
- Do they have a connection to the Ryakujin?

---

#### **THE 40% CORPSE**

**Who tries to absorb it?**
- Does someone in Pristania seek to become the "new Kami"?
- Does Free attempt to steal it?
- Does Meiji want it to complete his power?
- Do Arjan/Lopney need it to unlock their full potential?

**Is it destroyed? Absorbed? Hidden forever?**

---

#### **POWER INHERITANCE**

**How do Arjan/Lopney gain Kami's four abilities?**
- Do they absorb the 40% from the corpse?
- Is it a gradual awakening as they grow?
- Does each gain 2 abilities (split between them)?
- Or do they both eventually unlock all 4?

---

#### **ENDGAME**

**"The Dark God Arises" (Arc 6):**
- Does this refer to Jashin awakening?
- Or does someone else become a "dark god" (absorbing Kami's corpse + Jashin's power)?
- Is there a final confrontation between:
  - Arjan/Lopney vs. Jashin?
  - Arjan/Lopney vs. Meiji?
  - All factions vs. a new threat?

---

## NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

### **THEMES TO EXPLORE**

- **Free Will vs. Determinism:** Meiji fights for freedom but is literally programmed
- **Morality:** Is absolute morality (Kami) or free choice (Meiji) correct? Or is it a false dichotomy?
- **Family:** Blood vs. chosen family (Arjan/Lopney with Gallan, Meiji with Rajin/Kensuke)
- **Redemption:** Can Gallan atone? Can Kami's legacy be salvaged? Can Rajin forgive?
- **Identity:** Arjan/Lopney discovering they're reincarnations, Meiji discovering he's a weapon
- **The Cost of Power:** Resurrection, sealing, reincarnation all have prices

---
