# CHAPTER 1: "I'M LEAVING"

---

## ACT 1: THE LETTER

The candlelight flickered.

Gallan Byronstrike sat hunched over the wooden desk, its surface scarred by years of use that weren't his. The borrowed room. The borrowed furniture. Even the candle came from Pristania's stores.

Everything here belonged to someone else.

His pen scratched against paper, then stopped. The half-finished sentence stared back at him, accusatory. 

He'd killed men without hesitation. Commanded soldiers in battle. Erased entire encounters from living memory with nothing more than a thought.

But this—putting his resignation into words—felt impossible.

Gallan set the pen down and dragged both hands across his face. His palms came away damp. When had he started sweating?

"How difficult," he muttered to the empty room.

The candle's flame wavered in response, casting dancing shadows on the walls. Outside, Pristania's headquarters settled into nighttime quiet. Somewhere in the distance, voices carried through stone corridors—laughter, conversation, the sounds of people who still believed in something.

He used to be one of them.

Gallan picked up the pen again. His hand trembled slightly. He steadied it against the desk's edge and forced himself to continue.

---

*To the Leadership of Pristania,*

*I am writing to inform you of my resignation as Apostle. What follows is my explanation.*

The words flowed easier now. Not because they hurt less, but because he'd rehearsed them a thousand times in his head over the past three years.

*Kami always preached his ideas of morality to the world. Many of us followed him when he founded this organization. We believed in his vision—a world guided by justice and compassion, where people like us, with our Nouryoku, could build something better.*

Gallan's jaw clenched. His handwriting grew tighter, more controlled.

*We weren't the only ones. Several others began to hold seminars, spread the word. There are few of us with abilities, so it made sense to stick together. Kami focused on the ideas of justice and compassion. He wanted the best life for all of us. Many stood with him.*

The pen tip pressed harder into the paper.

*But others did not.*

*Meiji.*

Just writing the name made Gallan's chest tighten. He could see that face—sharp, cold, those purple eyes that saw too much and cared too little.

*That guy came out of nowhere and started saying nonsense. "Kami is authoritarian." "Kami doesn't represent the absolute." "We have the right to choose our own lives." He spat on everything we were building.*

Gallan's breathing quickened. The memories came unbidden now: Meiji's speeches in the public square, his smirk when people started listening, the way he'd looked directly at Kami and called him a tyrant.

*That bastard founded his own organization—Free, he called it—and invited everyone who disagreed with what Kami and we were building to join him.*

*To top it all off, Meiji openly challenged Kami to a duel.*

*Kami saw it as an opportunity to prove the correctness of his ideology.*

Gallan stopped writing. His hand had frozen mid-sentence.

He could still see it. The arena. The thousands gathered to watch. Kami in his white robes, serene and confident. Meiji, young and burning with conviction.

The clash of their powers—

Light exploding against psychic force—

Kami's surprised expression when Meiji's attack pierced through his defenses—

The way Kami fell, like a puppet with cut strings—

The silence that followed.

*That day, we were all watching.*

Gallan's vision blurred. He blinked rapidly, but the tears came anyway, hot and unwelcome. They fell onto the page, smudging the ink.

He wiped them away roughly with the back of his hand, angry at himself. Crying wouldn't change anything. Kami was dead. Three years dead. And Gallan had stayed at Pristania long enough to watch everything fall apart.

The war that followed. The atrocities committed in Kami's name. The things Gallan himself had done.

Too much. It was all too much.

His hand moved again, faster now, almost violent in its urgency.

*That's why I've decided to leave.*

"That's why I've decided to leave!" He spoke the words aloud as he wrote them, his voice cracking.

*I'll leave the farewell to whoever wants it.*

"I'll leave the farewell to whoever wants it."

*Hopefully, I'll achieve a new life. Too much tragedy. I'm tired.*

"Too much tragedy." His voice dropped to barely a whisper. "I'm tired."

The pen clattered onto the desk. Gallan stood abruptly, the chair scraping against stone. He grabbed his pack from the corner—already prepared, had been for days—and walked to the door without looking back.

One hand on the doorknob.

One last chance to reconsider.

He opened the door and stepped through.

The hallway stretched empty before him. Somewhere distant, a door closed. Footsteps echoed, then faded.

Gallan activated Mental Erasure without thinking, a reflex honed by years of practice. To anyone who saw him now, he was a ghost—there but not there, noticed but immediately forgotten.

He walked through Pristania's halls for the last time.

Behind him, on the desk, the letter remained. The signature at the bottom stark and final:

*Gallan Byronstrike*  
*Former Apostle*

By morning, someone would find it. Read it. Understand what it meant.

By then, Gallan would be gone.

---

## ACT 2: THE ISLAND

Four months later, the island appeared through morning mist like something out of a dream.

Gallan stood at the bow of his small boat, one hand gripping the weathered wood as waves rocked beneath him. Salt spray misted his face. Behind him, the ocean stretched endless and empty—no other ships, no distant shores, nothing but water and sky meeting at the horizon.

Ahead: paradise.

Dense tropical forest blanketed the island in shades of green he'd almost forgotten existed. White sand beaches curved along the coastline, pristine and untouched. Dramatic cliffs rose from the water's edge like ancient sentinels, their faces dark with shadow and slick with ocean spray.

No smoke. No structures. No signs of human presence.

Perfect.

The boat's hull scraped against sand as Gallan guided it onto the beach. He stepped out into ankle-deep water, its warmth a shock after weeks of cold ocean travel. His boots sank into wet sand.

He stood there for a moment, listening.

Waves rushing onto shore. Bird calls from deep in the forest—unfamiliar species, their songs bright and strange. Wind rustling through palm fronds. The distant crash of surf against cliffs.

Nothing else. No voices. No engines. No war.

"This will do."

His voice sounded strange after days of silence. Rough. Uncertain. But certain enough for this.

Gallan pulled the boat higher onto the beach and tied it to a piece of driftwood thick as his arm. Then he shouldered his pack and walked into the forest.

---

The jungle swallowed him whole.

Immediately, the temperature changed. Under the canopy, the air hung thick and humid, heavy with the smell of earth and growing things. Sunlight filtered through leaves in scattered patches, painting the forest floor in dappled green-gold.

Gallan moved carefully, studying everything. The ground rose and fell in gentle slopes. Water sounds reached him from somewhere to his left—a stream, or perhaps a river. Game trails crisscrossed through the underbrush, suggesting deer or similar prey.

Good. He could work with this.

It took him most of the day to find the right spot.

Deep in the island's interior, far enough from the coast to be hidden but close enough for access. A clearing beneath towering trees, the ground mostly level. A stream burbled past twenty meters away—fresh water, clear and cold when he tested it.

Gallan set down his pack and looked up through the canopy. Afternoon sunlight slanted through the leaves, warm on his face.

For the first time in three years, something in his chest loosened.

He could disappear here. Truly disappear. Build something with his own hands. Live simply. Forget.

Be forgotten.

---

**Weeks passed in a blur of labor.**

Gallan woke with the sun and worked until darkness forced him to stop. His hands, once smooth from wielding power instead of tools, grew calloused and rough. Blisters formed, burst, hardened into calluses. Muscles he'd neglected during his years at Pristania remembered what it meant to work.

First: clearing the site.

He hacked away undergrowth with a machete purchased months ago in a mainland port town whose name he'd already erased from his own memory. Vines thick as his wrist. Thorned bushes. Saplings that bent and snapped under his axe.

The work was mindless. Mechanical. It left no room for thinking.

Then: felling trees.

The axe bit into wood again and again and again, each swing precise, economical. No wasted motion. Old soldier habits died hard. He'd planned the cabin's frame before he cut the first tree—knew exactly how many beams he needed, what lengths, what thicknesses.

Trees fell with groaning crashes that sent birds screaming into the sky. Gallan ignored them. Stripped branches. Measured. Cut. Stacked.

The pile of timber grew.

Then: construction.

Foundation posts driven deep into earth. Cross-beams lashed and pegged into place. Walls rising board by board. The cabin took shape slowly, stubbornly, like something growing from the island itself.

Gallan worked in silence, speaking to no one. Sometimes days passed without him using his voice at all.

It was exactly what he wanted.

---

One afternoon, three weeks into construction, Gallan paused mid-swing.

The hammer hung in the air above a half-driven nail. His arms trembled slightly—not from exhaustion, but from something else.

He looked down at his hands.

Covered in sawdust. Wood stain darkening the creases of his palms. Fresh scratches across his knuckles from where he'd scraped them against rough bark that morning.

These hands.

These same hands had killed. Not in honest combat—he could have lived with that. But with his Nouryoku. Mental Erasure. He'd reached into people's minds and erased himself from their memories, left them standing confused and vulnerable while Pristania soldiers moved in for the kill.

Clean hands. No blood. Just... emptiness where he'd been.

How many families had woken up the next morning wondering what happened? Knowing someone they loved was dead but unable to remember why? Unable to remember the man who'd made it possible?

Gallan's hands tightened on the hammer.

But here, now, these same hands were building something.

Creating instead of destroying.

It wouldn't balance the scales. He knew that. Nothing could balance what he'd done.

But it was something.

He flexed his fingers, feeling the ache in his joints, the burn of honest labor.

Then he went back to work.

---

By the time the roof went up, Gallan had almost forgotten what Pristania's halls looked like.

Almost.

The cabin stood complete: one story, four rooms, simple but functional. Sturdy walls that would hold against tropical storms. A roof that didn't leak. Windows positioned to catch the breeze and morning light.

Inside, he'd crafted basic furniture from island timber. A bed frame (no mattress yet, but palm fronds would do). A table. Two chairs—he'd built two without thinking, then realized he had no one to sit in the second one.

He left it anyway.

A space for cooking. Storage for the tools and supplies he'd brought. Everything needed for a solitary life.

Gallan stepped back and surveyed his work.

It wasn't beautiful. It wasn't clever. But it was his, built with his own hands, and it would keep the rain off his head.

Enough.

---

That evening, Gallan sat by the river with a fishing line in the water.

The sun hung low, painting everything in shades of amber and rose-gold. The stream gurgled past, cool and clear. Insects hummed in the air. Somewhere deeper in the forest, something large moved through the undergrowth—probably a deer.

The line jerked.

Gallan pulled it up smoothly, hand over hand. A fish broke the surface, silver scales flashing. It fought against the line, twisting and flailing.

He watched it struggle for a moment.

Not with hunger. Not with satisfaction.

Just... watching.

At Pristania, food had appeared on tables as if by magic. Someone else's labor, someone else's kill. He'd never thought about where it came from.

But here, now, he was the one providing. Taking only what he needed. Clean. Honest.

The fish's struggles weakened.

Gallan pulled it onto the bank and dispatched it quickly, mercifully. No suffering. Just necessity.

He cleaned it with practiced efficiency and wrapped it in leaves for cooking.

Small satisfaction settled in his chest, warm and unexpected.

This was right. This was real.

---

Days blurred into weeks.

A routine established itself without conscious thought:

Wake with dawn. Wash in the stream. Eat simply—fruit from the forest, fish from the river, vegetables from the small garden plot he'd started near the cabin.

Work. Always work. Improving the cabin. Clearing more land. Building furniture. Exploring the island's interior, mapping it in his mind.

Hunt when meat was needed. Fish when the river was calm. Gather firewood. Tend the garden.

Eat again as the sun set. Sit outside and watch the sky darken.

Sleep.

Repeat.

No orders. No missions. No killing.

No one to erase.

The nightmares still came sometimes. Gallan would wake in darkness, heart pounding, the ghost-weight of memory pressing on his chest. But they came less frequently now. Less vivid.

The island was working its medicine on him, slow and patient.

---

Four months after his arrival, Gallan sat outside his completed cabin and watched the sunset.

The sky blazed orange, then pink, then deep purple. The ocean—visible through gaps in the trees—caught the light and threw it back in glittering fragments. Birds settled into the canopy with soft calls and rustling wings.

Peace.

Complete, absolute peace.

Gallan's face was still. No tension in his jaw. No haunted look in his eyes. Just... quiet.

It had been four months since he'd left Pristania. Four months since he'd used Mental Erasure. Four months since he'd spoken to another human being.

The work was done. The cabin stood solid. The island was his.

Maybe this was enough.

Maybe he could live here, forgotten by the world, and forget in return.

Gallan exhaled deeply, releasing tension he hadn't known he was holding.

The sun sank below the horizon. Darkness rushed in to fill the spaces between the trees.

He stood, stretched, and went inside.

---

That night, Gallan ate alone at his handmade table.

Simple meal: fish, roasted tubers from his garden, water from the stream. He ate slowly, tasting each bite. No rush. No one waiting.

The cabin felt lived-in now. Worn-in. As if it had always been here.

As if he'd always been here.

Gallan finished eating and pushed the plate away. The candle flickered on the table, casting familiar shadows on familiar walls.

Tomorrow would be the same as today. And the day after that. And the day after that.

It was what he wanted.

It had to be enough.

He blew out the candle.

In the sudden darkness, Gallan found his way to bed by memory. He lay down and stared at the ceiling, barely visible in the starlight filtering through the window.

Tomorrow. The same tomorrow. Forever.

Good.

His eyes closed.

For once—finally—sleep came easily.

---

## ACT 3: THE DISCOVERY

The light came without warning.

No thunder. No tremor. No sound at all.

Just light.

Gallan's eyes snapped open. For a disoriented moment, he didn't know where he was—the room was wrong, too bright, everything washed out in pale, sickly radiance.

Then he sat up.

Through the gaps in his cabin's wooden walls, through the window, light poured in from outside. Brilliant. Unnatural. So bright it hurt to look at, even filtered through walls and leaves.

His heart hammered against his ribs.

Gallan threw off his blanket and moved to the window, old instincts screaming at him. Through the forest canopy, he could see it:

A beam of light descending from the sky.

Not diffuse like moonlight. Not warm like sunlight. This was focused, coherent, like something purposeful. It pierced straight through the forest canopy somewhere to the east, cutting through leaves and branches to strike the ground below.

Gallan's breath caught.

Ten seconds. Fifteen. The beam hung there, impossibly bright against the night sky, turning the forest into a maze of stark shadows and blinding white.

Then it vanished.

Darkness slammed back like a curtain dropping. Gallan's eyes, light-shocked, saw nothing but afterimages.

"What the hell...?"

His voice sounded harsh in the sudden quiet. Rough with sleep and alarm.

Gallan didn't hesitate.

He grabbed nothing—no weapon, no supplies, no time. Just himself. Mental Erasure activated before he was fully conscious of the choice, old soldier habits taking over.

He ran out of the cabin barefoot.

---

The forest was dark.

Gallan's eyes struggled to adjust after the beam's brilliance. Moonlight filtered through the canopy in scattered patches, barely enough to see by. His feet found the ground by memory more than sight—he'd walked these paths enough times to know them blind.

His mind raced as he ran.

*An attack? Have they found me?*

*Something else?*

*What could produce light like that?*

He didn't know. Didn't care. Whatever it was, he had to see it. Had to know if his sanctuary had been compromised.

The path led east, toward where he'd seen the beam strike. Gallan moved fast and silent, Mental Erasure making him invisible even to the nocturnal animals. A deer looked up as he passed, then immediately looked away, its mind sliding past him like water past stone.

Four months of living here had mapped the island into his bones. He knew this path. Knew the slight rise twenty meters ahead, the fallen log to step over, the place where tree roots broke through the earth like grasping fingers.

He reached the cave entrance and stopped.

He'd passed this cave dozens of times. A simple natural formation, stone walls and a low ceiling, nothing remarkable. He'd looked inside once during his first weeks on the island—empty, no signs of animal dens, no reason to explore further.

Until now.

Above the cave, a hole gaped in what had been solid stone just hours ago. Perfectly circular, edges smooth and unnatural. Starlight streamed through it, creating a pillar of fainter light that illuminated the cave's interior.

No smoke. No heat. No scorch marks on the stone.

Just... the hole.

Gallan's heart pounded. He deactivated Mental Erasure and stepped into the cave.

His eyes adjusted to the dimness. Stone walls. Dirt floor. The hole in the ceiling directly overhead, maybe two meters across.

And then he heard it.

Crying.

Baby cries.

Gallan's blood went cold.

---

He moved deeper into the cave, his bare feet silent on stone.

The crying grew louder. Desperate. One voice high and wailing, another quieter but no less insistent.

Then he saw them.

Two babies lay on the cave floor directly beneath the hole in the ceiling.

Gallan froze.

They were small. Impossibly small. Newborns or close to it. One flailed with tiny fists, face red and scrunched with crying. The other whimpered more quietly, shivering against the cold stone.

No blankets. No carriers. No sign of whoever had brought them here.

The cave was empty except for them.

Gallan dropped to his knees beside them, his mind struggling to process what he was seeing.

"Who—" His voice cracked. "Where did you—"

The louder baby's cries intensified, piercing in the cave's acoustics. The quieter one shuddered, its tiny body wracked with cold.

Gallan looked around frantically. His soldier's training kicked in: assess the situation, gather information, determine the threat.

He checked every corner of the cave. Every shadow. Every possible hiding place.

Nothing.

He exited the cave at a run and circled it completely, looking for footprints, broken branches, any sign that someone had been here. He activated Mental Erasure and extended his awareness, feeling for the tell-tale gap where another person might be hiding.

Nothing. He was alone.

The babies' cries echoed from inside the cave, plaintive and growing weaker.

Gallan returned to them.

They were still there. Still crying. Still alone.

No answers. No explanation.

Just two lives, left here to die.

---

Gallan knelt again, his knees protesting against the hard stone.

His mind fought itself.

*This isn't my problem.*

Logical. True. He'd come here to escape responsibility, not acquire more of it.

*I came here to be alone.*

He'd built his cabin for one person. Planned a solitary life. This would ruin everything.

*I can't—I'm not—*

Qualified? He'd never raised children. Never even held a baby before.

But even as these thoughts raced through his mind, the quieter baby's hand reached out. Tiny fingers, each smaller than his pinky nail, closed around his index finger.

Gallan's breath caught in his throat.

The grip was weak. Trembling. But determined.

The louder baby's cries softened slightly when Gallan leaned closer, his presence apparently some small comfort against the darkness and cold.

He looked down at them.

Two lives. Two chances.

Two children who would die here if he walked away.

"I don't know where you came from."

His voice was quiet. Steady. The decision already made somewhere beneath conscious thought.

"But I won't leave you here."

Gallan scooped them up, one in each arm. Awkward—he'd never done this before, didn't know the right way to hold them. But protective. Gentle despite his callused hands.

They were so small. So impossibly fragile. How did anyone survive being this small?

The crying quieted. Not completely, but enough. They pressed against his chest, seeking warmth. Finding safety in his arms despite everything.

Gallan stood carefully, adjusting his hold to keep them secure.

Then he walked out of the cave and back toward his cabin.

---

The forest seemed different now.

Moonlight filtered through the leaves the same as always. The path felt familiar beneath his bare feet. Ocean waves crashed in the distance, their rhythm unchanged.

But everything had shifted.

Gallan looked down at the babies in his arms. The louder one had stopped crying entirely, making small snuffling noises against his chest. The quieter one's eyes were open—dark eyes that seemed to look at him with something approaching trust.

He didn't know their names. Didn't know where they'd come from or who had sent them.

But as he carried them back to his cabin, Gallan Byronstrike made a silent vow:

He would protect them.

No matter what came.

No matter the cost.

This was his redemption. Not escape. Not solitude. This.

For the first time since he'd left Pristania—since before Kami's death—Gallan felt something he thought he'd lost forever.

Purpose.

---

Candlelight spilled from the cabin's windows as Gallan approached.

He'd left the candle burning on the table when he ran out. It still flickered there, warm and golden against the darkness.

Gallan paused at the threshold. Looked down at the children in his arms one more time.

The decision was already made. Had been made the moment the quieter baby grabbed his finger. But this was the moment it became real. Crossing this threshold changed everything.

No going back.

Gallan stepped inside.

The door closed gently behind him, shutting out the night and its mysteries.

Inside, warmth. Light. Safety.

A new beginning.
