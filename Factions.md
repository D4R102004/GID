#### **Core Beliefs**

**Free Will as Fundamental Right:**
- Humans should choose their own moral path
- No person or organization has the right to force morality on others
- Individual choice matters more than imposed righteousness
- People learn and grow through their own decisions (including mistakes)

**Opposition to Pristania:**
- Rejects Kami's vision of absolute, enforced morality
- Believes Pristania's authoritarianism is tyranny disguised as righteousness
- Challenges the idea that any one person/group knows "the right way" for everyone

**Equality & Diversity:**
- Everyone has the potential to make the world better
- Differences should be welcomed, not crushed into uniformity
- Collective improvement through individual freedom

#### **Philosophy in Practice**

**Decision-Making:**

- All opinions considered before decisions are made
- Transparency in leadership accessibility

**Daily Life:**
- Members live normally - eat, socialize, pursue interests
- Free to contribute to the cause as they see fit
- No mandatory duties or enforced participation
- Community operates organically rather than through rigid structure

**Contrast with Pristania:**
- **Pristania:** Vertical military hierarchy, enforced moral code, righteousness through obedience
- **Free:** Horizontal community structure, individual choice, righteousness through personal growth

### **HIERARCHY & CHAIN OF COMMAND**

**Organizational Structure (Vertical):**

```

**Authority Flow:**

---

### **GENERAL MEMBERSHIP**

#### **How to Join Pristania**

**Three Primary Pathways:**

1. **Bloodline/Family Connection**
   - Born into Pristania families
   - Well-connected individuals have advantages
   - Example: Claudia Whanell (daughter of James) became Emperor through prowess, but connections helped

2. **Contributions**
   - Prove usefulness to Pristania through:
     - Financial support (funding)
     - Intelligence gathering (information)
     - Services (skills, abilities, resources)
   - Demonstrate alignment with Kami's ideals

3. **Training Course**
   - Pristania offers training to potential members they identify
   - Rigorous program testing commitment and ability
   - Examples: Gallan and Glayne both entered through this path
   - Selective recruitment (Pristania must deem you worthy first)

**Member Expectations:**
- **Support the organization** in all needed capacities
- **Enforce morality** in the world (spread Kami's teachings)
- **Follow Kami's ideals:** Help others, deliver justice, uphold righteousness
- **Live righteously** as examples of the moral code
- **Keep identities secret** (critical given illegal status)

**Leaving Pristania:**
- **Defection is possible** but carries consequences
- **Under Kami's rule:** Defection allowed, not hunted
- **Under current leadership (especially Perlereina):** Leaving = betrayal
  - **Active hunting** of defectors by Perlereina and her supporters
  - Extreme risk for those who leave
- **Viewed as betrayal by:** Perlereina, Glayne, Bellsaw (fanatic faction)
- **Historical defectors:** Gallan (Apostle), Kensuke (Emperor) - both joined Free

---

### **PRISTANIA'S TECHNOLOGICAL ASSETS**

#### **Diominiciel's Creations**

**Arsenal of Machines:**
Pristania possesses robots, androids, and advanced machines developed by Diominiciel:

   - *[Function and capabilities TBD]*

3. **Android Unit 41R - Nicknamed "Air"**
   - *[Function and capabilities TBD]*

4. **Biological Unit 5P4C3 - Nicknamed "Space"**
   - *[Function and capabilities TBD]*

**Note:** These units serve Pristania's operations and report to the Kamigami (primarily Diominiciel as their creator).

---

### **IDEOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY**

#### **Core Beliefs (Kami's Teachings)**

**The Path to Perfection:**
- **Absolute morality** leads to a perfect world
- Righteousness must be **enforced**, not just encouraged
- Clear moral code eliminates chaos and suffering

**The Moral Code:**
- **Help others** - altruism as duty
- **Deliver justice** - punish criminals and wrongdoers
- **Uphold good values** - maintain righteousness at all times
- **Spread Kami's teachings** - evangelize the moral path

**Fatal Flaw (Inherited from Kami):**
- **Authoritarian enforcement** rather than inspiration
- Forces morality instead of nurturing it
- Commands righteousness rather than fostering genuine belief

#### **Philosophy in Practice**

**Enforcement of Morality:**
- **Internal:** Strict discipline among Pristania members
- **External:** Spread Kami's teachings where possible (limited by secrecy)
- **Cannot enforce everywhere:** Illegal status restricts operations
- **Proxy influence:** Control Kamino from shadows, influence believers outside Pristania

**Disagreement with Leadership:**
- Members **can voice disagreement** but cannot revocate decisions
- **Vertical hierarchy** means orders from Kamigami must be followed
- **Resentment** toward those who oppose (especially Perlereina)
- Historical example: Hirohiko opposed siblings' vengeance, led to internal conflict

**Preaching Kami's Ideology:**
- **Pristania members:** Operate in secrecy (illegal organization)
- **Civilian believers:** Those who genuinely follow Kami's teachings openly
  - Not Pristania members themselves
  - Face no arrest risk (not in illegal organization)
  - Actually spread the ideology more effectively than secret Pristania

**Contrast with Free:**
- **Pristania:** Vertical hierarchy, enforced moral code, righteousness through obedience
- **Free:** Horizontal structure, individual choice, righteousness through personal growth

---

### **POST-KAMI'S DEATH TRANSFORMATION**

#### **How Kami's Death Changed Pristania**

**Emotional Impact:**
- **Grief-stricken** - orphaned leadership, lost their founder/father
- **Reckless** - vengeance drives decision-making
- **Hatred-filled:**
  - Sworn enemies of Free (especially Meiji)
  - Resent Vista Alegre (city's police declared them illegal)
  - Bitter toward the world that "let their father die"

**Operational Changes:**
- **Forced into secrecy** - illegal status limits operations
- **More extreme** - vengeance warped Kami's teachings
- **Fractured internally:**
  - **Fanatics** (want war at all costs): Bellsaw, Perlereina, Glayne
  - **Ideologues** (believe in Kami's teachings, not vengeance): Diominiciel, Zafiro
  - Hirohiko opposed vengeance entirely (now absent)

**Current Unity (Arc 2):**
- Despite internal philosophical differences, Pristania **remains unified**
- No formal divisions or splinter groups
- Shared hatred of Free and commitment to Kami's memory holds them together
- **For now** (ominous future implication)

---

### **CURRENT STATUS (ARC 2)**

#### **Relationship with Free**

**Tension Level:** Cold war - extreme hostility without active combat

**Mutual Hatred:**
- **Pristania's view:** Free killed Kami, betrayed righteousness
- **Free's view:** Pristania represents authoritarianism and tyranny
- **Deep ideological divide** compounded by personal losses (war casualties)

**Espionage Attempts:**
- Both sides attempt intelligence gathering
- **Limited success** - neither knows the other's headquarters location
- Discovery of either base would likely restart the war

**War Triggers:**
- Finding each other's headquarters
- Major provocation or attack
- **Pristania is eager** to restart conflict
- **Free actively avoids** renewed warfare (war-weary)

**Perlereina's Personal Vendetta:**
- **Target:** Meiji (killed her father in front of her)
- **Support:** Diominiciel supports her hatred of Meiji
- **Opposition:** Hirohiko opposed vengeance (now absent after family conflict)
- **Approach:** Perlereina operates independently at times in pursuit of revenge

**Recruitment:**
- Pristania does NOT actively recruit from Free (mutual hatred too deep)
- Free recruits former Pristania members (Gallan, Kensuke examples)

---

#### **Relationship with Civilians**

**Secrecy Level:** Secret organization (Option A)

**Public Awareness:**
- **Some civilians know Pristania exists** (especially in Kamino)
- **Most do not** - operates in shadows
- **Vista Alegre Police Department:** Declared Pristania illegal
- **Other regions:** Vary (Kamino welcomes them secretly)

**Recruitment:**
- Operates secretly
- Identifies potential members before approaching
- Training course invitation-only

**No Territory Control:**
- Does **not** function as government or control population directly
- **Shadow control** of Kamino (manipulation, not overt rule)
- Influences from behind the scenes

**Organizations Aware of Pristania:**
- Free (enemy)
- Jitsumoto (third faction)
- Some people in Vista Alegre (government, police)
- Kamino citizens (many adore Pristania as "Kami's organization")

---

#### **Kamino - The Hidden Asset**

**What is Kamino?**
- Town founded by Kami
- Population consists of people loyal to Kami and his teachings
- Located east of the unnamed island

**Pristania's Relationship:**
- **Shadow control** - Pristania controls Kamino from behind the scenes
- **No direct involvement** - members don't reveal identities
- **Government puppets** - Kamino's officials work under Pristania without knowing the full truth
- **Adoration:** Most Kamino citizens revere Pristania as Kami's legacy organization
  - Do not know the organization is illegal elsewhere
  - See Pristania as righteous and holy

**Pristania's Use of Kamino:**
- *[TBD - recruitment? Safe haven? Resource gathering? Intelligence?]*

- Built on vision of absolute morality creating perfect world
- Recruited 4 Emperors as elite force (initially served alongside them as 4th)
- Founded Kamino as loyal population base

**Kami's Leadership Era:**
- Idealistic but authoritarian enforcement of morality
- Lenient toward defectors (allowed leaving without punishment)
- Raised the Kamigami within Pristania's ideology
- Groomed organization for continuation after his death (unknowingly)

**The Duel (18 years before Arc 1):**

- Fragile peace established

**Post-War Period:**

- Internal conflict among Kamigami over vengeance vs. ideology
- Hirohiko's "disappearance" from Pristania

- Gallan's defection after Hirohiko's absence

**Current Era (Arc 2):**
- Operating from hidden headquarters
- Cold war with Free
- Diominiciel and Perlereina as active leaders
- Unified but philosophically fractured
- Eager for renewed conflict (especially Perlereina)
