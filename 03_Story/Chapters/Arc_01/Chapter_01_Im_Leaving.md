# CHAPTER 1: "I'M LEAVING"

---

## ACT 1: THE LETTER

The room was small. Dim. A single candle burned on the wooden desk, its flame barely moving in the still air.

Gallan sat hunched over a piece of paper. Pen in hand. Half-written words stared back at him.

He'd killed men without hesitation. Erased entire battles from memory. But this?

This was harder.

He set the pen down. Rubbed his face. Exhaled.

**"How difficult."**

His voice was rough. Quiet. Like he'd forgotten how to speak.

He picked up the pen again. Stared at the page.

**"Let's summarize."**

---

**[Close-up on the paper as Gallan begins to write. His handwriting is neat at first, controlled. The words appear as his voice narrates them.]**

---

> *To the Leadership of Pristania,*
>
> *I am writing to inform you of my resignation as Apostle. What follows is my explanation.*
>
> *Kami always preached his ideas of morality to the world. Many of us followed him when he founded this organization. We believed in his vision—a world guided by justice and compassion, where people like us, with our Nouryoku, could build something better.*
>
> *We weren't the only ones. Several others began to hold seminars, spread the word. There are few of us with abilities, so it made sense to stick together. Kami focused on the ideas of justice and compassion. He wanted the best life for all of us. Many stood with him.*
>
> *But others did not.*
>
> *Meiji... That guy came out of nowhere and started saying nonsense. "Kami is authoritarian." "Kami doesn't represent the absolute." "We have the right to choose our own lives." He spat on everything we were building.*
>
> *That bastard founded his own organization—Free, he called it—and invited everyone who disagreed with what Kami and we were building to join him.*
>
> *To top it all off, Meiji openly challenged Kami to a duel.*
>
> *Kami saw it as an opportunity to prove the correctness of his ideology.*
>
> *That day, we were all watching.*

---

**[Camera pulls back from the letter to Gallan's face. His hand has stopped moving. The pen hovers above the page.]**

He could still see it.

The stadium. The crowds. Kami's white hair glowing in the sunlight. Meiji's cold purple eyes.

The clash of powers. Light against psychic force.

And then...

The silence.

Kami on the ground. Dead.

**[Tears well in Gallan's eyes. His jaw clenches. His hand shakes.]**

He wiped his eyes roughly. Angry at himself for crying.

Snapped back to the page.

---

**[Gallan writing again, faster now. Angry strokes. His voice overlaps with his writing—he's speaking the words aloud as he writes them.]**

---

> *That's why I've decided to leave.*

**"That's why I've decided to leave!"**

> *I'll leave the farewell to whoever wants it.*

**"I'll leave the farewell to whoever wants it."**

> *Hopefully, I'll achieve a new life. Too much tragedy. I'm tired.*

**"Too much tragedy."**

His voice dropped. Quiet. Defeated.

**"I'm tired."**

---

**[Gallan sets the pen down firmly. Final. Done.]**

He stood.

Didn't look back at the letter.

Grabbed his bag from the corner. Already packed. He'd known this moment was coming.

He walked to the door. Paused.

One last chance to turn back.

He opened the door and left.

---

**[The room is empty now. Silent except for the candle's faint crackle. Camera slowly zooms in on the letter still sitting on the desk. Focus on the signature at the bottom:]**

> *Gallan Byronstrike*  
> *Former Apostle*

---

The letter would be found later that morning.

By then, Gallan Byronstrike would be gone.

---

## ACT 2: THE ISLAND

**[TITLE CARD: "Four Months Later"]**

---

The island appeared through the morning mist.

Gallan stood at the bow of a small boat. Alone. The ocean stretched endlessly behind him.

Ahead: dense tropical forest. White sand beaches. Cliffs rising from the water like ancient guardians.

No smoke. No structures. No people.

Perfect.

He stepped onto the sand. The boat rocked gently behind him, tied to a piece of driftwood.

He looked around. Listened.

Waves. Bird calls. Wind through trees.

Nothing else.

**"This will do."**

His voice was quiet. Certain.

He picked up his bag and walked into the forest.

---

**[MONTAGE BEGINS]**

Weeks passed.

The cabin took shape.

---

**[Gallan surveying the land]**

He found a clearing deep in the forest. Hidden beneath the canopy. Close enough to the coast for water. Far enough to disappear.

He marked trees. Planned the foundation. His movements were precise. Efficient.

Old habits.

---

**[Cutting timber]**

The axe bit into wood. Again. Again. Again.

Gallan worked methodically. No wasted motion. No hesitation.

Sweat dripped from his brow. He didn't stop.

---

**[Building the frame]**

The structure rose slowly. Wooden beams locked into place. Walls took shape.

Simple. Functional. Sturdy.

Built to last.

---

**[CHARACTER MOMENT #1: The Hands]**

Gallan paused mid-work. Hammer in hand.

He looked down at his palms.

Covered in wood sap. Sawdust. Dirt. Calloused from labor.

These hands had killed. Erased lives from memory. Left families wondering what happened to their loved ones.

But here, now, they were building something.

He flexed his fingers. Went back to work.

---

**[Completing the cabin]**

The roof went up. The door fit into place. Windows opened to let in light.

One story. Multiple rooms. Nothing fancy.

It was enough.

---

**[Interior setup]**

A bed. A table. Chairs. Basic furniture carved from island timber.

Gallan arranged everything carefully. A place for tools. A place for supplies.

A place to sleep without nightmares.

Maybe.

---

**[CHARACTER MOMENT #2: The Fish]**

Gallan sat by the river. Fishing line in the water.

A tug. He pulled up a fish. It flapped in his hands, struggling.

He watched it for a moment.

Not with hunger. With something else.

He was providing for himself. Taking only what he needed.

No more. No less.

Clean kill. Quick. Merciful.

He prepared it for cooking.

Small satisfaction settled in his chest.

---

**[Establishing routine]**

Days blurred together.

Wake. Work. Eat. Sleep.

Fishing in the river. Hunting small game in the forest. Tending a small garden near the cabin.

No orders. No killing. No war.

---

**[CHARACTER MOMENT #3: The Sunset]**

Gallan sat outside his completed cabin as the sun set.

The sky turned orange. Pink. Purple.

Ocean waves crashed in the distance. Birds settled into the trees for the night.

Complete silence except for nature.

His face was peaceful. For the first time in years, the nightmares weren't in his eyes.

It had been four months. The work was done. The cabin stood solid. The island was his.

Maybe this was enough.

Maybe he could live here, forgotten by the world, and forget in return.

He exhaled deeply. Released tension he didn't know he'd been holding.

---

The work was honest. The solitude was absolute.

And for the first time in years, Gallan Byronstrike felt something close to peace.

---

**[MONTAGE ENDS]**

---

Gallan sat inside his cabin. A simple meal in front of him. Candle flickering on the table.

The cabin felt lived-in now. Worn-in. Like it had always been here.

Like he'd always been here.

He finished eating. Blew out the candle.

Lay down on his bed. Stared at the ceiling for a moment.

Tomorrow would be the same as today. And the day after that. And the day after that.

It was what he wanted.

It had to be enough.

He closed his eyes.

For once, sleep came easily.

---

## ACT 3: THE DISCOVERY

The light came without sound.

No thunder. No warning.

Just light.

Gallan's eyes snapped open.

The room was flooded with it. Pale. Eerie. So bright it hurt to look at.

He sat up. Disoriented.

Looked toward the window.

Through the gaps in the wooden walls, he could see it—a beam of light descending from the sky, piercing through the forest canopy in the distance.

Brilliant. Unnatural.

It lasted maybe ten seconds. Maybe fifteen.

Then it vanished.

Darkness returned.

Gallan didn't move. His heart pounded in his chest.

**"What the hell...?"**

His voice was rough. Alert.

Instinct kicked in.

He threw off his blanket. Grabbed nothing—no weapon, no bag. Just himself.

Mental Erasure activated before he even realized it. Old soldier habits.

He ran out of the cabin.

---

The forest was dark. Moonlight filtered through the trees in scattered patches.

Gallan moved fast. Silent. Invisible.

His mind raced.

*An attack? Have they found me?*

*Something else?*

He didn't know. Didn't care. He had to see.

The path through the forest was familiar now. Four months of living here had mapped it into his bones.

He reached the cave.

He'd seen it before. Passed by it dozens of times. Never had a reason to explore.

Until now.

The hole in the ceiling was visible. Fresh. Starlight streamed through it.

No smoke. No heat. No glowing marks.

Just... the hole.

Gallan entered cautiously.

His eyes adjusted to the darkness.

And then he heard it.

Crying.

Baby cries.

His blood went cold.

---

He moved deeper into the cave.

The crying grew louder. Desperate.

And then he saw them.

Two babies. Lying on the stone floor.

One crying loudly, flailing. The other quieter, whimpering.

No one else. The cave was empty except for them.

Gallan deactivated Mental Erasure. Dropped to his knees beside them.

Cold. They were so cold.

He looked around frantically. Searching for anyone. Anything.

Who left them here? Where did they come from?

He looked up at the hole in the ceiling.

The only answer.

**"Where... who would..."**

The louder baby's cries intensified. Scared. Alone. Cold.

Gallan's hands hovered over them. Uncertain.

And then the quieter one's tiny hand reached out. Grabbed his finger.

His breath caught.

---

He had to be sure.

Gallan stood. Moved quickly through the cave, checking every corner. Every shadow.

Nothing.

He exited the cave. Scanned the surrounding forest. Looked for footprints. Tracks. Any sign of another person.

Nothing.

The babies' cries echoed from inside the cave.

He returned to them.

They were still there. Still crying. Still alone.

No answers. No explanation.

Just two lives, left here to die.

---

Gallan knelt again.

His mind fought itself.

*This isn't my problem.*

*I came here to be alone.*

*I can't—I'm not—*

But then the quieter one grabbed his finger again. Held on.

The louder one's cries softened slightly when Gallan leaned closer.

He looked down at them.

Two lives. Two chances.

**"I don't know where you came from."**

His voice was quiet. Steady.

**"But I won't leave you here."**

He scooped them up. One in each arm. Awkward but protective.

They were so small. So helpless.

The crying quieted. Not completely, but enough.

They felt safe in his arms.

---

Gallan walked back through the forest.

The babies had stopped crying now. Their tiny bodies pressed against his chest, warm despite the cold night air.

Moonlight filtered through the trees. Ocean waves crashed in the distance.

The island was silent.

He looked down at them.

He didn't know their names. He didn't know where they'd come from.

But as he carried them back to his cabin, Gallan Byronstrike made a silent vow:

He would protect them.

No matter what came.

No matter the cost.

For the first time since he'd left Pristania, Gallan felt something he thought he'd lost forever.

Purpose.

---

**[Gallan enters the cabin with the babies. The door closes gently behind him. Warm candlelight glows from inside.]**

**[FADE TO BLACK]**
