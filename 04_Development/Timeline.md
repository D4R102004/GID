## AGE CALCULATION FORMULA

**To find current age (Arc 1):**
- Character born X years before Arc 1 = X years old in Arc 1
- Examples:
  - Meiji born ~35 years before Arc 1 = ~35 years old in Arc 1
  - Diominiciel born 45 years before Arc 1 = 45 years old in Arc 1
  - Perlereina born 36 years before Arc 1 = 36 years old in Arc 1

**To find age during past events:**
- Years before Arc 1 that character was born - Years before Arc 1 of event = Age during event
- Example: Perlereina in Arc 1 is 36 (born 36 years before Arc 1)
  - The Duel was 18 years before Arc 1
  - 36 - 18 = 18 years old during the Duel ✓
