## CORE RULES

### **NOURYOKU (能力) - "ABILITIES"**

**Definition:**
- Supernatural powers possessed by some individuals
- Not magic - treated as natural abilities in this world

**Core Principles:**
1. **No inherent stamina cost** - Abilities don't drain energy automatically
2. **Unique to each person** - Everyone's ability is different (duplicates possible but rare)
3. **Not faction-locked** - Powers appear randomly, not tied to organizations
4. **Random distribution** - Most people are powerless; abilities are uncommon
5. **Skill > Raw Power** - Strategy and technique matter more than pure strength

**Combat Philosophy:**
- **Nouryoku gives an edge, not dominance**
- Powerless fighters can defeat powered opponents with skill
- Team tactics and strategy are essential
- Environment and preparation matter

---

### **NAMING CONVENTION**

**Nicknames/Codenames:**
- Characters often have nicknames based on their abilities or reputation
- Trend started by the god-tier beings (Magnus Dei, Opus Dei, Mei Dei)
- Examples:
  - Kami (神 - "God")
  - Ellipse (Glayne - uses ellipses)
  - Rachi (Cristopher - 拉致 "Kidnap")
  - Saimin (Ichiro - 催眠 "Hypnosis")

## GOD-TIER ABILITIES

### **KAMI'S POWER - "GOD'S ARSENAL"**

**User:** Kami (deceased), fragments in Arjan (30%), Lopney (30%), Kami's corpse (40%)

#### **Four Core Abilities:**

**1. 神の槍 (Kami no Yari) - God's Spear**
- Summons multiple energy spears of light
- Emerge from dimensional portals around the user
- Multi-directional attacks (can attack from any angle)
- Spears can be controlled individually
- High piercing damage

**2. 神の盾 (Kami no Tate) - God's Shield**
- Curved energy barrier
- Frontal defense (protects user and allies behind them)
- Blocks most attacks and abilities
- Can withstand god-tier strikes
- Curved shape allows deflection of projectiles

**3. 神の裁き (Kami no Sabaki) - God's Judgment**
- Massive beam of light descends from above
- Devastating area-of-effect attack
- Burns and severely damages all targets in area
- Requires line of sight to sky
- High energy cost (can't spam)

**4. Flight**
- Levitation and aerial mobility
- Self-explanatory
- Essential for god-tier combat positioning

---

#### **Hidden Ability: Resurrection**

**Function:**
- Can revive the dead
- Brings someone back to life exactly as they were before death
- No time limit (can revive someone who died years ago)

**Limitations:**
- **Maximum 2 uses per user**
- **After 2 resurrections:** The POWER ceases to exist (user survives but becomes powerless)
  - This is the TRUTH
  - Hide told Kami a LIE: "After 2 uses, the USER ceases to exist"
  - Kami believed the lie, never used his 2nd resurrection out of fear

**Kami's Usage:**
- **1st resurrection:** Used on Megami (after she was shot)
- **2nd resurrection:** Never used (1 use remaining when he died)

**Current Status:**
- Resurrection ability split between Arjan/Lopney/corpse
- [TBD: Can they use it? Do they know about it?]

---

### **JASHIN'S POWER - "DARK GOD'S ARSENAL"**

**User:** Jashin (60% in comatose body, 40% possessing Hirohiko)

#### **Four Core Abilities (Inverted Mirror of Kami's):**

**1. 神の矛 (Kami no Hoko) - God's Halberd**
- Multiple dark energy projectiles
- Emerge from dimensional portals
- Functionally similar to Kami's spears
- Different visual aesthetic (dark/shadowy vs. light)
- Same multi-directional attack capability

**2. 神の壁 (Kami no Kabe) - God's Wall**
- Flat barrier wall (vs. Kami's curved shield)
- Frontal defense
- Blocks attacks and abilities
- Less deflection, more absolute blocking

**3. 神の招き (Kami no Maneki) - God's Beckoning**
- Beam of dark energy **rises from the ground** (vs. Kami's descending beam)
- Burns and damages enemies
- Area-of-effect attack
- Inverted directionality symbolizes dark/light duality

**4. Flight**
- Same as Kami's

---

#### **Hidden Ability: Sealing**

**Function:**
- Can seal beings or powers
- Creates a binding that suppresses consciousness/abilities
- Sealed target enters coma-like state

**Jashin's Own Sealing:**
- Jashin was sealed by Kami using Zenshin's power
- **Seal condition:** Lasts as long as Kami's power exists
- **Current status:**
  - Seal partially weakened (Kami's power fragmented)
  - Jashin semi-conscious (can manifest near his body)
  - 40% of power escaped, possessed Hirohiko
  - 60% remains with comatose body
- **Break conditions:**
  - If Kami's power is completely destroyed → seal breaks fully
  - If Arjan/Lopney use 2nd resurrection → power ceases → seal breaks

**Usage by Jashin:**
- Never used before being sealed
- [TBD: Can he use it if freed?]

---

### **MEGAMI'S POWER - "CARTOON TRANSFIGURATION"**

**User:** Rajin (Megami in disguise)

#### **Primary Ability:**

**Shapeshifting with Cartoon Logic**
- Can transform into **anything**
- Follows cartoon/toon physics (reality-bending)
- Similar to "The Mask" (Jim Carrey film)
- Examples:
  - Transform into objects
  - Change appearance permanently
  - Stretch, morph, defy normal physics
  - Create cartoon-style effects

**Current Usage:**
- **Permanent disguise as "Rajin"**
  - Different face, voice, mannerisms from Megami
  - Maintained constantly for 30+ years
  - Only Kensuke knows the truth

**Combat Applications:**
- Versatile offense and defense
- Reality-bending evasion
- Creative problem-solving
- Infiltration and disguise

---

#### **Hidden Limitation: Pacifism Lock**

**The Fatal Flaw:**
- **Cannot kill**
- Hardcoded into the power by Ryakujin designers
- Megami can brutally harm, torture, incapacitate
- But the **final killing blow always fails**
- Weapon breaks, attack misses, target survives

**Why This Exists:**
- Ryakujin designed her as "neutral mediator"
- Built-in safeguard to prevent her from killing
- They deemed her a "failure" when they discovered this
- Abandoned her because she couldn't complete kill orders

**Impact on Story:**
- Megami couldn't kill Jashin (even though she wanted to)
- Can't kill Kami's killers (powerless to enact lethal revenge)
- Must rely on others for lethal force
- Thematic: The mediator cannot destroy, only transform

---

## SPECIAL MECHANICS

### **REINCARNATION MECHANIC**

**When a god-tier user dies:**

Their power **fragments into 3 parts:**

1. **30% → "Positive" reincarnation**
   - Manifests as a new being
   - Tends toward positive traits of original
   - Example: Arjan carries Kami's caring nature

2. **30% → "Negative" reincarnation**
   - Manifests as a new being
   - Tends toward opposite/shadow traits
   - Example: Lopney carries Kami's strategic ruthlessness

3. **40% → Remains in the corpse**
   - Can be absorbed by others
   - Preserved if body is intact
   - Key to power inheritance

**IMPORTANT:**
- After **2 resurrections**, power is permanently destroyed
  - No reincarnation possible
  - Power ceases to exist entirely
- Reincarnations can eventually inherit all 4 core abilities
- Method of inheritance: [TBD in story]

**Kami's Death:**
- 30% → **Arjan** (positive fragment)
- 30% → **Lopney** (negative fragment)
- 40% → **Kami's corpse** (guarded by Kamigami, location secret)

**Implication:**
- Arjan and Lopney are unaware of their true nature
- They can potentially unlock all of Kami's abilities
- The 40% corpse is a power source others might seek

---

### **SEALING MECHANICS**

**Jashin's Seal (Created by Kami):**

**How It Works:**
- Uses the sealer's power as a binding
- Suppresses target's consciousness
- Puts physical body in coma
- Target remains alive but unconscious

**Duration:**
- Lasts as long as the sealing power exists
- **If sealer dies:** Seal weakens but may not break (fragments can sustain it)
- **If sealer's power is destroyed:** Seal breaks completely

**Current Jashin Seal Status:**
- Created using Kami's power ~40 years ago
- Kami died 18 years ago → seal weakened
- Kami's power fragmented (Arjan 30%, Lopney 30%, corpse 40%)
- Seal still holds but Jashin is semi-conscious
- 40% of Jashin's power escaped, possessed Hirohiko
- 60% remains with comatose body in Pristania chamber

**Break Conditions:**
- Arjan/Lopney use 2nd resurrection → Kami's power destroyed → seal breaks
- All 3 fragments (Arjan, Lopney, corpse) destroyed → seal breaks
- Time alone won't break it (needs power destruction)

---

### **CONTINGENCY PROGRAMMING (MEIJI)**

**Hidden Ryakujin Weapon System:**

**Trigger:**
- Activates when detecting god-tier powers (Kami or Jashin specifically)
- Will activate against Arjan/Lopney (carry Kami's fragments)
- Will activate against anyone who absorbs Kami's 40%

**Transformation:**
- **Physical changes:**
  - Wings sprout from back
  - Eyes gain distinctive marking/glow
  - Hands turn into claws
  - Feet become eagle talons
  - Snake tail emerges
  - **Chimera form** - hybrid beast

**Power Boost:**
- **Massively stronger** - overpowered Kami "absurdly easily"
- **Faster** - overwhelming speed advantage
- **Enhanced abilities** - psychokinesis amplified significantly
- Designed to counter god-tier abilities specifically

**Meiji's Awareness:**
- **Does NOT know this exists**
- Thinks power boost during duel was "adrenaline"
- No idea he's a Ryakujin weapon
- Will be shocked if/when he transforms again

**Story Implications:**
- Meiji fights for "free will" while being programmed
- His ideology is genuine but his existence was calculated
- Major identity crisis when truth is revealed

## POWER INTERACTIONS

### **Nullification (Lopney)**

**Power:** Nullifies active abilities via eye contact

**How It Works:**
- Lopney looks at target with intent
- All active Nouryoku effects cease
- Target's ability itself isn't removed (just current manifestations)
- Examples:
  - Arjan's spheres vanish
  - Gallan's Mental Erasure stops (he becomes visible)
  - Flight users fall
  - Energy attacks dissipate

**Limitations:**
- Requires eye contact
- Requires intent (doesn't nullify accidentally)
- Only affects active abilities (not passive traits)
- Doesn't work on physical enhancements already applied
- **Currently dormant** in Lopney (awakens gradually)

**God-Tier Interaction:**
- Can nullify Kami's spears, shield, judgment beam
- Can nullify Jashin's attacks
- Can nullify flight
- **Ultimate counter** - forces opponents to fight without powers

**Thematic Purpose:**
- Lopney felt "powerless" but has the ultimate power
- Levels the playing field (forces skilled combat)
- Represents Kami's mercy (ability to strip power from the corrupt)

---

### **Mental Erasure (Gallan)**

**Power:** Erases memories of himself from targets

**How It Works:**
- Target forgets Gallan exists
- Forgets ever meeting him
- Forgets conversations, events involving him
- Effect is permanent unless broken

**Limitations:**
- Must be applied actively (not automatic)
- Can be broken by:
  - Extreme emotional triggers
  - Nouryoku specifically designed to break mental effects
  - Strong-willed individuals may resist
- Doesn't work on written records (only memories)
- Gallan remains visible while in target's presence

**Strategic Use:**
- Gallan uses it when visiting mainland (no one remembers him)
- Hides his island location (people forget they saw him)
- Can't be tracked because nobody remembers meeting him

**Counter:**
- Glayne (his brother) eventually breaks through it [Arc 1]
- [TBD: How does Glayne break it? Emotion? Special ability?]

---

### **Copy Abilities**

**Users:** Shiro Kiryuin (Zafiro), Megami (Copy is one of her abilities)

**Megami's Copy:**
- Can permanently duplicate any Nouryoku
- Sees it once → can use it forever
- No limit on number of copied abilities

**Shiro's Copycat (Kiryuuin Evolution):**
- [TBD: Specifics of how his version works]
- [TBD: Differences from Megami's Copy]

---

## COMBAT STRATEGIES

### **Against God-Tier Opponents:**
1. **Avoid direct confrontation** - god-tier abilities are overwhelming
2. **Use environment** - force them into disadvantageous terrain
3. **Target concentration** - disrupt their focus
4. **Nullification** - Lopney's ability is the ultimate counter
5. **Overwhelming numbers** - even gods can be overwhelmed
6. **Exploit weaknesses** - every ability has limitations

### **Power Scaling:**
- **God-Tier** (Kami, Jashin, Megami, Meiji with contingency)
- **Elite-Tier** (Kamigami, 4 Emperors, strongest faction members)
- **High-Tier** (Experienced powered combatants)
- **Mid-Tier** (Average powered individuals)
- **Low-Tier** (Weak/limited abilities)
- **Powerless** (Skilled fighters without abilities)

**Key Principle:** Higher tier doesn't guarantee victory. Strategy, skill, and teamwork matter.
