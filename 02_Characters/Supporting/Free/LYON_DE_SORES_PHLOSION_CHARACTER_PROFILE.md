## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Bomb Generation (Unnamed)**

**Codename:** Phlosion (his Free nickname)
**Ability Name:** [No specific name - just "bomb generation"]

**How It Works:**

**Generation:**
- **Bombs appear in his hands**
- Can control detonation timing
- Can **detonate manually** by **snapping his fingers**

**Size Control:**
- **Small bombs:** Quick to create, easy to throw, many simultaneously
- **Large bombs:** Better explosion, but:
  - Heavier (harder to throw)
  - Takes more time to create
  - Very few simultaneously
  - Difficult for him to make

**Range:**
- **Throwing distance:** Based purely on arm strength
- As far as he can physically throw them
- No supernatural range boost

**Appearance:**
- Look like **grenades**
- **Circular shape**
- Have a **wick/fuse** (candle-like thing on top)

**Immunity:**
- Like all Bakuzoku, **immune to his own explosions**
- Can detonate at point-blank range safely

---

### **Combat Style (When In Control)**

**Strategy:**
- **Keeps distance** - fights mid-range
- **Never too reckless** - strategic approach
- **Fast movement** - agile despite robust build
- **Analyzes situations quickly** - very intelligent fighter

**Approach:**
- Throws bombs tactically
- Controls detonation timing for maximum effect
- Uses terrain to advantage
- **Fights really well** when focused

**Limitations:**
- **Does NOT work well with others** in combat
- Fights solo (never shown fighting alongside allies)
- Risk of Kyousen makes teamwork dangerous
- Prefers independent action

---

### **KYOUSEN (狂戦) - THE "DISEASE"**

**What Free Believes:**
- Lyon has an **"apparent disease"**
- Medical condition of unknown origin
- **Tried treatments** but all failed
- No cure, no prevention
- Misdiagnosed due to ignorance of Bakuzoku

**The Truth:**
- **Inherited Bakuzoku trait** - genetic, not disease
- All Bakuzoku experienced this
- Part of why Ryakujin deemed them failures
- Nantes likely had it too

---

### **Kyousen Episode Mechanics:**

**Frequency:**
- **Completely unpredictable**
- Can happen **twice in same week** or **months apart**
- **No prevention possible**
- No warning signs

**Triggers:**
- **NONE** - happens spontaneously
- Not stress, not emotion, not environment
- Random genetic activation
- Impossible to predict or avoid

**Onset:**
- **Eyes roll up** - whites showing
- **Demented expression** appears
- **Convulsions and shaking** uncontrollably
- **Abrupt, erratic movements** begin

**During Episode:**
- **No awareness** - completely unconscious of actions
- **No memory** - doesn't remember what happens
- **Cannot be stopped** - no way to calm or restrain him
- **Growls and grunts** - no speech
- **Detonates bombs randomly** - throws everywhere
- **Wreaks havoc** - destroys surroundings
- **Very disgusting to witness** - horrifying transformation

**Duration:**
- **Completely random**
- Can be **quick** (minutes?) or **last for hours**
- **Unpredictable** - no pattern
- No way to tell when it will end

**Aftermath:**
- **Wakes up** from the state confused
- **Sees the destruction** he caused
- **Marks on arms** from things falling on him
- **Deep shame and horror**
- No memory of what happened

**Impact on Life:**
- **Discriminated** - called "freak" by some Free members
- **Unreliable** - not allowed on important missions
- **Feared** by some people
- **Despised** by others (Light, Elysia, etc.)
- Seen as **literal ticking time bomb**
- **Constant worry** - never knows when next episode hits
- Tries to **always be the best with people** to compensate

---

### **After Learning Truth (Arc 2+):**

**Understanding:**
- **Finally knows it's genetic** - he's half-Bakuzoku
- Part of his heritage, not random disease
- **Relieved somewhat** - knowing other Bakuzoku had it helps
- Still worried but understands himself better

**Marsella's Research:**
- Part of her scientific work
- Trying to help him control or prevent episodes
- [Details to be developed in story]
- Possible treatments or management strategies

**Can He Control It?**
- **For the time being: NO**
- It's **inherent to Bakuzoku** as they were created
- Could think of control developing later
- But not guaranteed - may be permanent condition

## **THE KYOUSEN TRAGEDY**

### **Before Knowing the Truth:**

**Free's Explanation:**
- Lyon has **"apparent disease"**
- Medical condition of unknown origin
- **No cure** - all treatments failed
- Just have to manage it

**Impact on Lyon's Life:**

**Social:**
- **Discriminated** - called "freak"
- **Feared** by some members
- **Despised** by others (Light, Elysia, etc.)
- Seen as **literal ticking time bomb**
- **Not allowed on important missions** - unreliable

**Emotional:**
- **Despises his condition** deeply
- **Constant worry** - when will next episode hit?
- Sees himself as **threat to others**
- Tries to **always be the best with people** to compensate
- **Marks on arms** remind him constantly
- **Worst memories** - waking to see destruction

**Isolation:**
- **Not approachable** because of condition
- **No friends** besides Lyzander and Gabriella
- **Miserable existence** especially last 5 years
- **Wanted to leave** Free but nowhere to go

---

### **After Learning the Truth (Arc 2):**

**Understanding:**
- **Finally knows:** He's half-Bakuzoku
- Kyousen is **genetic** - inherited from father
- All Bakuzoku experienced this
- **Not disease** - part of his heritage
- Part of why Ryakujin deemed Bakuzoku failures

**Emotional Impact:**
- **Understanding himself better**
- **Relieved somewhat** - knowing others had it helps
- Not alone in this condition
- **Still worried** but has context now
- Makes sense why treatments failed

**Marsella's Help:**
- **Part of her research** - helping her son
- Trying to find control or prevention
- Scientific approach to genetic condition
- [Details to be developed in story]
- Possible treatments or management

**Can He Control It?**
- **For the time being: NO**
- It's **inherent to Bakuzoku** as created
- Ryakujin couldn't fix it
- May be **permanent condition**
- Could develop control later (TBD)
- But not guaranteed

**Living With It:**
- At least now he **understands why**
- Has mother who accepts him completely
- Not discriminated at Pristania for it
- (Though not trusted for other reasons)
- Small comfort in understanding
