### **Sample Dialogue:**

> "You thought you'd come here, and ruin everything like last time? You were wrong weren't you? Fucking WRONG."
> *(Furious, violent, convinced he's protecting Free)*

**To Arjan (later as mentor):**
> "Come on kid, that shit you're doing? You get on like this and think. Use your powers with your imagination."
> *(Tough love, pushing him to be better, invested in his growth)*

**To Meiji (relationship argument):**
> "Listen I don't want this to look anything more than me fucking your brains up, that clear? I... (Sigh) Meiji it's complicated."
> *(Defensive, struggling with feelings, scared of vulnerability)*

### **Verbal Habits:**

- Respectful honorifics with superiors (Commander Tairin, etc.)

---

## **BACKSTORY**

### **Before Free:**

**Early Life:**
- Civilian background, likely rough neighborhood/upbringing
- Developed delinquent tendencies (fighting, tattoos, "bad boy" image)
- **No Nouryoku** - powerless in a world where abilities = status
- Compensated by building extreme physical strength

**Pristania Rejection:**
- Wanted to "do something big" with his life
- Applied to Pristania's training program
- **Rejected** for not having powers
- **Mocked** by Pristania recruiters:
  - "All muscle, no brain"
  - "A delinquent with nothing special"
  - Told that others (like Perlereina) were stronger
- This humiliation fueled his **hatred of Pristania**

---

### **Joining Free (During the 15-Year Peace):**

**Why Free Accepted Him:**
- Free values human potential regardless of powers
- Saw his raw strength and combat talent
- Needed Security personnel during peacetime

**Initial Motivation:**
- Pristania rejected him, Free didn't
- Wanted purpose and belonging
- Believed in Meiji (the man who stood against authority)

**Training Under Elysia:**
- Assigned to Elysia (Security instructor)
- **Difficult student** - improvises, does things his way
- Talented but undisciplined
- Struggles with controlling himself and thinking rationally
- Respects Elysia highly despite being rebellious

**Forced Mentorship - Tased (Leandrys):**
- **Punishment** for bad behavior (bullying kids)
- Assigned to train 17-year-old Leandrys (Tased)
- Cristopher thinks Tased is "whatever, a bit of a wimp"
- Not a father figure relationship
- This teaches Cristopher **some** values about patience (sets groundwork for Arjan)

---

### **The Incident 5 Years Ago & Meeting Meiji:**

**Free HQ Attack by Pristania:**
- Most children in Tairin's care killed
- Gabriella captured (presumed dead)
- Massive trauma for everyone in Free

**Meeting Meiji:**
- Sometime during/after this crisis
- Meiji was emotionally devastated, isolated
- **Cristopher became Meiji's refuge** from grief
- Started as physical comfort, became relationship

**Relationship Timeline:**
- Together for ~5 years (from attack to Arc 2)
- **Secret relationship** - only Lyzander knows (deduced it through investigation)
- Not even Kensuke or Rajin know

---

## **RELATIONSHIP WITH MEIJI**

### **The Dynamic:**

**Meiji's Side:**
- Finds refuge from grief in Cristopher
- **All caring and a bit silly** with him
- Calls him **"Crissty"** (affectionate nickname Cristopher hates)
- Wants intimacy beyond sex (cuddling, movies, ice cream dates)
- Loves him, but "in a somewhat childish way"
- Acts "too all-knowing" sometimes (frustrates Cristopher)

**Cristopher's Side:**
- **Mixed feelings** - loves Meiji but struggles with it
- **Tough guy persona** clashes with vulnerability
- **Internalized homophobia** - being gay conflicts with masculine image
- **Snaps at Meiji** often (can't stand his attitude sometimes)
- Loves Meiji's character and what he represents for Free
- Supports Meiji through grief but gets frustrated

**Sexual Dynamic:**
- Cristopher is **top**, Meiji is **bottom** (very clear power dynamic)
- They meet primarily for sex
- Meiji wants more (emotional intimacy, romance)
- Cristopher keeps it physical (easier than dealing with feelings)

**Public vs. Private:**
- **In public:** Some closeness but nobody notices it's romantic
- **In private:** Meiji is affectionate, Cristopher is defensive
- They don't hang out publicly as a couple

---

### **The Complication:**

**Cristopher's Internal Struggle:**
- Loves Meiji but resents needing him
- Wants to be "just sex" but has real feelings
- Masculine identity vs. homosexual relationship
- Feels unworthy (no powers, rough background) vs. Meiji (god-killer, president)

**The Ice Cream Argument (Sample Scene):**
- **Context:** Just finished having sex
- **Meiji:** Asks Cristopher to go eat ice cream at Elysia's place (Delicya's)
- **Cristopher:** States he "really isn't into fucking him that day"
- **Meiji:** Suggests they could cuddle, watch a movie, "do whatever - it always feels good with you"
- **Cristopher:** Snaps → *"Listen I don't want this to look anything more than me fucking your brains up, that clear? I... (Sigh) Meiji it's complicated."*

**What "It's Complicated" Means:**
- Cristopher has feelings he can't admit
- Scared of vulnerability and emotional intimacy
- Internalized shame about being gay
- Doesn't feel good enough for Meiji
- Trying to protect himself by keeping distance

---

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **No Nouryoku:**

**The Reality:**
- **Completely powerless** - no supernatural abilities
- This is his greatest insecurity
- Compensates through extreme physical training

**What He Has Instead:**
- **Peak human strength** - "all muscle"
- **Brutal punching power** - can obliterate opponents
- **Combat talent** - natural fighter
- **Tactical thinking** (when he bothers to use it)

---

### **Combat Style:**

**Nickname Origin - Rachi (拉致 - "Kidnap"):**
- Chosen to **intimidate opponents**

- Lacks powers (hard countered by certain abilities)

**Notable Victory:**

---

### **As an Instructor:**

**What He Teaches Arjan:**
1. **Martial arts** - hand-to-hand combat basics
2. **Confidence** - mental toughness, believing in yourself
3. **Maturity in battle** - don't panic, stay focused
4. **Battle tactics** - think before acting (ironic, but he learns this too)
5. **Creative sphere usage** - "Use your imagination" (combine spheres with combat in new ways)

**Teaching Style:**
- Tough love (harsh but effective)
- Leads by example (trains alongside Arjan)
- Pushes hard (no coddling)
