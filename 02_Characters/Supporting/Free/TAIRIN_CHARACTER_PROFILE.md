## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Golden Ring Manipulation**

**Nickname Origin:** Tairin (大輪 - "Large Wheel")

**Core Ability:**
- Generates rings of solid golden light out of nowhere
- Can create rings of any size (from tiny cuffs to massive hoops)
- Rings are tangible, solid matter once materialized
- Golden color = they hit HARD (dense, heavy)

**Ring Mechanics:**

**Creation:**
- Can materialize rings anywhere within range
- Rings can pass through objects during materialization
- Once created, they are solid and cannot phase

**Control:**
- **Remote control** - manipulates rings telekinetically after creation
- Can maintain many rings simultaneously
- Larger rings reduce total number she can control
- Rings remain until she dismisses them (no time limit)

**Manipulation:**
- Can expand/contract rings to crush or release
- Can open and close rings to encapsulate targets
- Can spin rings at high speed for cutting/impact
- Can stack/layer rings for complex restraints

---

### **Combat Applications:**

**Primary Tactic - Restraint:**
- Creates rings around enemy limbs/body to immobilize
- "Cuffs" opponents quickly and efficiently
- Can bind multiple enemies simultaneously
- Ring encapsulation is nearly impossible to break

**Secondary Tactic - Offense:**
- Throws rings like projectiles (spinning discus attacks)
- Expands rings rapidly to crush/break targets
- Layers multiple rings for overwhelming force
- Golden material hits with devastating impact

**Mobility:**
- **Flight:** Creates large ring beneath herself, sits/stands on it
- Flies like a witch on a broomstick (aesthetic complete)
- Can carry others on her rings
- Moderate to fast flight speed

**Defensive Use:**

- Encircles herself with spinning rings (shield)
- Can intercept projectiles with precisely-placed rings

---

**Broom Weapon (When Serious):**
- Pulls out a broom for intense fights
- **Fire property:** Can ignite the broom in flames
- Fights like a fire dancer in exhibitions
- Still flies on rings (places rings beneath broom for aesthetic)
- Broom is both weapon and focus for her power

**Integration:**
- Restrains enemy with rings, follows up with martial strikes
- Uses rings to control distance and positioning
- Broom strikes combined with ring manipulation
- Fire broom for devastating finishing moves

---

### **Combat Philosophy:**

**Approach:**
- Restrain enemies quickly and efficiently (end fights fast)

- Never wastes energy, every move has purpose
- Protects others while eliminating threats

**Teaching Style:**
