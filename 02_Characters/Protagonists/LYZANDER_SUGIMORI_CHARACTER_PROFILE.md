## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Lizard (Blue Fire Manipulation)**

**Core Ability:**
- Creates **blue fire** from his hands and feet
- **Not normal fire** - has unique property of **solidifying**
- Solidified fire resembles **ice** in appearance and behavior

**How It Works:**

1. **Fire Generation:**
   - Emerges from limbs (hands and feet)
   - **Cannot be separated from body**
   - **Does NOT throw fireballs** - fire stays connected to him
   - Think flamethrower, not projectile

2. **Solidification:**
   - Can **solidify fire into ice-like substance**
   - Forms **weapons:** swords, spears, etc.
   - Can materialize **bridges** for traversal
   - Substance is **like ice** - breaks with relative ease depending on thickness

3. **Combat Applications:**
   - **Scorch opponents** with blue flames
   - **Solidify fire around them** - freezes them alive (extremely brutal)
   - **Freeze technique used ONCE** in entire story (too cruel)
   - **Materialize weapons** and fight with them
   - **Hover/Levitate** by ejecting fire from feet (jet pack effect)
   - **Does NOT fly** in literal sense - merely hovers, increased mobility

**Signature Technique:**
- **Materialized sword combat** - creates blade, fights with it
- **Burning enemies** - scorching attacks
- **Freezing alive** (once only) - solidifies fire around target, fatal

---

### **Power Assessment:**

**Strengths:**
- **Very strong Nouryoku**
- Versatile (offense, mobility, utility)
- Blue fire aesthetic is striking
- Can create weapons on demand
- Levitation gives tactical advantage

**Limitations:**
- **Cannot split fire** - must stay connected to body
- **No long-range attacks** - can't throw fire at distance
- **Mid-range fighter** - needs proximity but not close combat
- **Weak to water, sand, rocks** - environmental counters
- **Solidified substance breaks easily** if not thick enough

---

### **Combat Philosophy:**

**Approach:**
- **Prefers to avoid fighting** unless against Pristina
- **Defensive overall** - doesn't initiate
- **Mid-range attacks** - not close combat (not skilled at martial arts)
- **Fears hurting enemies too much** - fire is unstable and powerful
- **Tries to redeem opponents** - win them to his side
- **Genuine surges of revenge** at times (rare)

**Influenced by Sadness:**
- **Doesn't enjoy fighting** - no pleasure in combat
- **Less aggressive** than others
- **Calculative and careful** - thinks before acting
- **Not reckless** - sadness makes him cautious

**Fatal Combat Flaw:**
- **Gets sense of "done enough"** in fights
- When opponent is on their knees, assumes victory
- **Lets guard down** - thinks no more conflict needed
- **Premature victory assumption** - can be exploited

---

### **Fighting Style:**

**Weapons:**
- **Materialized sword** (from solidified fire)
- **Moderately skilled** in swordsmanship
- Not a master, but competent

**Training:**
- **No martial arts** training
- Some swordsmanship knowledge
- Relies heavily on Nouryoku
- **Trained by Tairin** (alongside Lyon and Gabriella)

**Tactics:**
- Attack from mid-range
- Avoid close combat
- Create weapons as needed
- Use fire for area denial
- Hover for positioning
- **Reason with opponents** during battle

**Philosophy:**
- Fights to achieve goals (protect, revenge, freedom)
- Depends on point in story
- **Not eager to harm** - prefers redemption
- **Conflict-avoidant** unless Pristina involved
