## **CHARACTER ARC TRACKER**

### **Starting Emotional State (Arc 1):**
- Restless, eager to leave the island
- Insecure about lacking powers but hides it well
- Confident in martial arts but feels it's "not enough"
- Frustrated with the limitations of island life

### **Core Internal Conflict:**
- **Wants:** To prove she's strong despite lacking powers, to see the world
- **Needs:** To realize her worth isn't tied to abilities, to discover her hidden power
- **Flaw preventing growth:** Defines herself by what she lacks rather than what she has

### **Potential Growth Trajectory:**
- **Early Arc:** Forced off island (gets her wish, but not how she wanted)
- **Mid Arc:** Power awakens - feels validated but must grapple with its nature (negation)
- **Late Arc:** Learns her power is just as god-tier as Arjan's, confronts what that means
- **Endgame:** Embraces both her martial skill AND her power as complementary strengths

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

Lopney represents **the struggle for self-worth in a world of gifts:**
- Works twice as hard to achieve what others get naturally
- Her arc proves that **earned skill + hidden potential = true strength**
- Her power (nullification) is thematically perfect: she negates others' gifts, forcing them to face her on equal terms

She's the **strategic foil** to Arjan's emotional heart - where he avoids conflict, she seeks it; where he protects, she proves herself.
