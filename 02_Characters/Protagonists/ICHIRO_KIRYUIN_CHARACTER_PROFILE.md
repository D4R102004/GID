## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Saimin (催眠 - "Hypnosis")**

**Base Form - Two-Sense Manipulation:**

**Core Ability:**
- Controls **TWO of the five senses** at once
- Can make targets misperceive form, shape, mass, feel, smell, etc.
- **Activation:** At will (no special condition)
- **Targets:** Can affect multiple people simultaneously
- **Range:** [TBD - likely line of sight or within certain distance]

**Mechanics:**
- Choose which two senses to manipulate per use
- **Examples:**
  - **Sight + Touch:** Target sees and feels a dragon, but it's actually a fly
    - Won't smell, sound, or taste like a dragon
    - Physical damage is still just a fly (harmless)
  - **Sight + Hearing:** Target sees and hears a giant buzzing mosquito 3 feet away
    - Won't smell, feel, or taste real
  - **Any combination** of two senses can be chosen

**Creative Applications:**
- Make a fly look like a dragon
- Make a swamp look like a garden of flowers
- Create multiple illusory copies of himself
- Make enemies attack their own allies (disguised as Ichiro)
- Mask his true location while attacking from elsewhere
- Torment opponents psychologically

**Limitation - The Counter:**
- **Enemies must discover which two senses are being manipulated**
- **Trust the three senses that AREN'T affected**
- Example: If sight and touch are manipulated, trust hearing/smell/taste
- Smart opponents can triangulate reality through unaffected senses

**Nickname Origin:**
- "Saimin" (催眠) means "Hypnosis"
- Reflects his illusion-based abilities
- **Note:** Base form is NOT "完全催眠" (Complete Hypnosis)

---

### **Evolved Form - 完全催眠 (Kanzen Saimin - "Complete Hypnosis")**

**When Unlocked:**
- **End of Arc 4** - triggered by Goro's death in his arms
- Evolution energy released as Goro dies (Kiryuin evolution mechanic)

**Enhanced Ability:**
- Controls **ALL FIVE SENSES** simultaneously
- Complete sensory domination
- No counter based on "unaffected senses"
- Victims experience total illusion indistinguishable from reality

**Power Difference:**
- Base: Clever enemies can find cracks in the illusion
- Evolved: Perfect illusion, no way to detect what's real through senses alone
- Requires meta-knowledge or external help to break

---

### **Combat Philosophy:**

**Approach:**
- **Manipulative and deceptive** - mirrors his ability
- Tricks opponents, torments them psychologically
- Exploits every weakness methodically
- Analytical - calculates optimal strategy
- **Not a brawler** - avoids direct confrontation

**Morality:**
- **Situational killing** - doesn't enjoy it, but will do it if necessary
- Prefers non-lethal takedowns when possible
- Can be **cruel and merciless** when situation demands it
- Punishes enemies without hesitation

---

### **Fighting Style:**

**Tactics:**
- **Illusion warfare** - creates false targets, multiples of himself
- **Stealth attacks** - strikes from unexpected angles while senses are fooled
- **Surgical strikes on vital points** - assassin precision
- **Defensive fighting** - can't take many hits, avoids damage
- **Psychological warfare** - breaks enemy morale through deception
- **Escape artist** - knows when to retreat ("Always live another day")

**Strengths:**
- Creative power usage (limitless applications)
- Trained assassin techniques
- Analytical mind (calculates weaknesses instantly)
- Psychological dominance through fear/confusion

**Weaknesses:**
- **Physically frail** - can't tank hits
- **Not skilled in martial arts** - relies on powers + assassin techniques
- **Stealth-focused** - struggles in open, direct combat
- **Requires focus** - impulsive actions when distracted

**Weapon:**
- **Knife** - standard assassin tool
- Tries not to wound fatally unless necessary
- Precision strikes to vital points

---

### **Relationship with Assassin Training:**

**Conflicted Legacy:**
- **Resents the skills** - hates what they represent
- **Still uses them** - pragmatic about survival
- **Doesn't resent being Kiryuin** - resents family's ideology
- **Finds redemption** - uses powers to protect, not kill
- **Enjoys using skills for good** - performing magic, defending friends

**Philosophy:**
- Believes Kiryuin family can have a better future
- Wants to be the first "good" Kiryuin in history
- Hopes to redefine what the name means

**Starting Point (Arc 1-3):**
- **Ichiro HATES his father**
- Deep resentment and anger
- Fled to escape him
- Views Goro as symbol of everything wrong with Kiryuin family

**The Truth About Goro's Abuse:**

**Shiro's Story (First Son):**
- Shiro didn't develop Nouryoku while at home
- Goro grew desperate, thought it was matter of time
- Started **mistreating Shiro**, blaming him for not having powers
- Called Shiro the **"weak link"** of family
- Obsessed with Shiro failing as next Head
- **This abuse led Shiro to escape**

**Ichiro's Story (Second Son):**
- Ichiro **did develop powers early** (Saimin)
- Goro became **ruthless with training**, obsessed with creating "perfect Head"
- Ichiro despised being a killer but agreed reluctantly
- **Shiro's death** (actually fake, Ichiro doesn't know) broke Goro
- Free sabotaged Pristania ship, Goro believed Shiro died
- Goro developed **alcoholic tendencies**
- **Mistreated Ichiro while drunk**, apologized later
- Cycle of abuse and apology

**The Breaking Point:**
- Ichiro discovered **Shiro's diary** at Kiryuin Manor
- Read about all the abuse Shiro documented
- Had **intense argument with drunk Goro** over Shiro
- Left the next day while Goro was in shock
- Goro never told Ichiro that Shiro ran away - lied and said Shiro "enrolled in Pristania and died"

**Worst Memory:**
- Arguing with father about his brother running away
- Learning truth about Shiro from diary, not from Goro

**Best Memories:**
- Playing with "uncle" Yurisha (Goro's drinking buddy)
- Learning assassination tactics (enjoyed the training itself)
- **But:** Never imagined his fate was chosen for him from the start

**Arc 3 - First Confrontation:**

**Setup:**
- Pristania hires Goro to kill targets
- Ichiro and friends (Arjan, Lopney, Lyzander, Yonoa) are the targets
- Ichiro is keeping guard while others sleep

**The Conversation:**

> **Ichiro:** "Father..."
> **Goro:** "Oh, and I wondered who I'd meet with? Well met, my son. It's been a long time."
> **Ichiro:** "I'd have preferred we would not see each other again. I can't allow you to continue, father."
> **Goro:** "I don't believe it. You've ever been the ally of Free? Have you forgotten what they did to your brother?"
> **Ichiro:** "Think you I would forget such a thing? No. But neither do I seek revenge against them."
> **Goro:** "Still uttering the same nonsense. No matter. Now is the time to put aside your weak sentimental side and join me in fulfilling your duty to your family."
> **Ichiro:** "Goro! In the name of my brother, I will defeat you here and now. For my friends."

**Battle Outcome:**
- Ichiro **loses** - no chance against Goro's evolved ability
- **Goro decides to give him a chance** to be with friends
- **Goro retreats** instead of finishing the job
- **Impact:** Ichiro learns his father can show something good
- Still angry, but this + friends' advice pushes him to visit Goro in Arc 4

**Arc 4 - Reconciliation:**
- Ichiro visits father, spends time with him

- **What he needs:** Just affection and an apology
- **Goro provides both**
- **End of Arc 4:** Goro dies in Ichiro's arms
  - Triggers Kiryuin evolution (完全催眠 unlocked)
