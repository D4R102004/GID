---

## **PERSONALITY BY ERA**

### **Ryakujin Facility (Age 0-18):**
- Kind, obedient, somewhat rebellious
- **Less rebellious than Jashin and Megami** - found comfort in structure
- Rocky but genuine friendship with Hide (manipulated without knowing)
- **Relationship with siblings:**
  - **Jashin:** Intense rivalry, brotherly love mixed with jealousy
  - **Megami:** Obsessive love (unhealthy fixation)

**The Jealousy:**
- Triggered when he saw Jashin and Megami's romantic tension
- Happened one night while Kami was kept for additional experiments
- Felt excluded, resented not being told
- This resentment festered, making Hide's manipulation easier

**The Dream Conversation:**
- One night, all three talked about their dreams
- **This is when Kami fell in love with Megami**
- Bonding moment that shaped his future desires

### **Post-Escape (Age 18-21):**
- **Determined** to live his dream with Megami
- **Traumatized** by the massacre, burying Jashin, killing Hide
- **Self-deception:** "It was for the greater good"
- Began constructing his ideology as a coping mechanism

### **Husband & Father (Age 21-30):**
- **Loving father** - the Kamigami had no better opinion of him
- **Especially fond of Perlereina** (youngest) - spoiled her
- **Devoted husband** - genuinely loved Megami, heartbroken when she left
- **Growing guilt** - the lie weighed heavier over time
- **Overprotective** - didn't want his family exposed to danger

### **Pristania Founder (Age 31-50):**
- **Conviction solidified** - Megami leaving proved he must "cleanse himself"
- **Saw her departure as confirmation** of his mission's importance
- **Raised Kamigami in his ideology** - prepared them for greatness
- **Warm but authoritative** - inspired trust, commanded obedience
- **Blind to his methods** - didn't see he was forcing morality on people

---

## **VOICE & DIALOGUE**

### **Speech Patterns:**
- **Formal and commanding** - speaks like a leader
- **Warm and paternal** - genuinely caring tone
- **Preachy** - always teaching, always making others learn
- **Complicated language** - speaks "above others" (divine vocabulary)
- **Inspiring** - followers felt uplifted by his words

### **Sample Dialogue:**

**Speaking to his children (father mode):**
> "You are daddy's girl, Paru. I love you."
> *(Gentle, affectionate, showing his soft side with Perlereina)*

**Addressing Pristania (leader mode):**
> "Now's the time for change. Humanity is to drive onwards to a better future, a future that we will forge with our own hands."
> *(Inspirational, commanding, messianic tone)*

**Final words to Megami (carrying Jashin's body):**
> "I love you. Your children love you. I was bad to my family. Don't do the same."
> *(Heartbroken, pleading, accepting responsibility but still offering advice)*

### **Verbal Patterns:**
- Uses complicated, elevated language
- Speaks as if teaching a lesson (even in casual conversation)
- References morality and righteousness frequently

---

## **IDEOLOGY - "ABSOLUTE MORALITY"**

### **The Vision:**
- **Core belief:** If everyone has the correct moral compass, the world becomes perfect
- **Method:** Make everyone follow a good moral compass (through teaching AND enforcement)
- **Definition of "absolute morality":** Doing the right thing, always. Being righteous at all times.

### **The Teachings:**
- Help others (altruism as duty)
- Punish criminals (justice must be served)
- Spread good words (evangelism of righteousness)
- Uphold good values (moral consistency)

### **Why He Believes This:**
- **Redemption mechanism:** He wronged those he loved (Jashin, Megami)
- **Self-cleansing:** If he makes the world better, he becomes better
- **Genuine conviction:** Truly believes this is THE solution to human suffering
- **Witnessed pain:** Traveling the world showed him humanity's darkness

### **The Fatal Flaw:**
- **He doesn't inspire - he enforces**
- People follow out of fear/obligation, not genuine belief
- He's blind to this - thinks he's helping
- "Nobody could prove him wrong" (until Meiji challenged him)

### **Kensuke's Disillusionment:**
- Kensuke (4 Emperor) was very liberal
- Saw that Pristania was **forcing** people to be righteous
- Recognized this as a travesty (perversion of Kami's good intentions)
- Defected, eventually helped raise Meiji to oppose Kami

---

1. **神の槍 (Kami no Yari) - God's Spear**
   - Multiple energy spears of light
   - Emerge from portals around him
   - Multi-directional devastation

2. **神の盾 (Kami no Tate) - God's Shield**
   - Curved energy barrier
   - Frontal defense
   - Blocks most attacks effortlessly

3. **神の裁き (Kami no Sabaki) - God's Judgment**

### **Hidden Ability - Resurrection:**
- Can revive the dead (twice maximum)

- **One use remaining:** Never used the second
- **Believes Hide's lie:** Thinks using it again will kill him (it won't - only the power dies)
- **Secret plan:** Considered killing dormant Jashin, then resurrecting him (to "fix" his sin)
- **Why he didn't:** Couldn't bring himself to do it

---

- **Predictable** - relies on overwhelming force, not cunning

---

### **The Duel with Meiji:**

**Why He Accepted:**
- **To make an example** - crush this upstart teenager publicly
- **Prove his ideology** - show that absolute morality defeats chaos
- **Underestimated Meiji** - didn't see a 16-year-old as a real threat

**Opening:**
- Dominated easily (veteran experience + god-tier power)
- Enjoyed demonstrating superiority
- Confident, almost playful

**Turning Point:**
- **Meiji's Ryakujin contingency activated** (hidden programming)
- Massive boost to Meiji's strength/speed
- Kami didn't understand what happened - just saw Meiji suddenly matching him

**Desperation:**
- Kami grew desperate, fought **"ruthlessly"**
- Tried dirty and desperate techniques
- **Lost his composure** - became frantic, savage
- Took great effort trying to corner Meiji
- **Did NOT break his moral code** but came close

**Final Moments:**
- One last clash with Meiji
- **Surprise and sadness** in his eyes
- Looked at Meiji, opened his mouth (no words came)
- Fell dead
- **Last thoughts:** Megami, Jashin, his children
- **Saw it as:** Completely unexpected - he couldn't believe he would die

**He didn't know:**
- Meiji was a Ryakujin weapon designed to kill him
- The contingency programming triggered specifically because Kami was god-tier
- His death would fragment his power into reincarnations

---

## **KEY RELATIONSHIPS**

### **Jashin (His Brother - Sealed):**

**Before the Conspiracy:**
- **Loved him** - genuine brotherly bond
- **Intense rivalry** - pushed each other, competed constantly
- **Jealousy festered** when he saw Jashin and Megami's romantic tension
- **Resentment:** "Why didn't they tell me? Why am I excluded?"

**The Conspiracy:**
- **Hide's manipulation** preyed on this jealousy
- Kami thought it was his own idea (didn't realize he was being used)
- **Convinced himself:** "Jashin is dangerous, I'm protecting Megami"

**After Sealing Him:**
- **Guilt** - knows what he did was wrong
- **Justification** - "I wouldn't be here otherwise" (built life on this sin)
- **Hope for redemption** - considered killing and resurrecting Jashin someday
- **Couldn't do it** - couldn't bring himself to end his brother's life

**Visiting the Body:**
- Kept Jashin in a secret chamber in Pristania HQ
- Visited sometimes (frequency unknown)
- What did he say to the comatose body? *[Haunting image]*
- **Saw it as "his responsibility"** - burden he must carry

---

### **Megami (His Wife - Separated):**

**How He Loved Her:**
- **Genuinely, deeply** - would do anything for her
- **Obsessive quality** - fixation that started in the facility
- Saw her as the only person who understood him
- Her love validated his existence

**The Lie:**
- Started feeling worse as time went on
- Knew he was living a fraud
- **Self-deception:** "It's for the greater good, she's happy"
- Built a family on a foundation of betrayal

**The Confession:**
- **"If I'm to clean the world, I must clean myself first"**
- Gave her EVERYTHING - jealousy, conspiracy with Hide, sealing Jashin
- **Expected anything:** Death, forgiveness, abandonment
- **Was ready to die** by her hands if necessary

**Her Reaction:**
- **Absolute rage and disgust**
- Felt betrayed by the person she loved most
- Entire life felt like a blatant lie
- Nearly killed him on the spot

**Perlereina's Intervention:**
- 2-year-old entered during the confrontation
- Megami couldn't kill in front of her daughter
- **Kami's realization:** "I still have something worth living for - my kids"
- **This saved his life** but destroyed his marriage

**After She Left:**
- Guessed she'd go to the Ryakujin facility
- Followed her there
- **Pleaded with her** before taking Jashin's body
- **Was rejected** - she wouldn't forgive, wouldn't return
- **His interpretation:** "I did the right thing. Losing her proves I cleansed my soul."
- **Broke his heart** but solidified his mission
- Saw himself as the "ultimate savior" who sacrificed everything

**Did He Try to Find Her Again?**

---

### **Hide (The Manipulator - Deceased):**

**What Kami Thought:**
- Hide was a genuinely caring person
- His friend (rocky but real)
- Trusted him completely

**The Betrayal:**
- Hide conspired with Kami to kill Jashin
- **Kami didn't realize he was being manipulated**
- Thought the plan was his own idea
- Hide planted the seeds, Kami watered them

**The Revelation:**
- Hide confessed during the facility massacre
- Told Kami about the conspiracy
- **Kami felt deeply betrayed** - his "friend" used him

**Why Kill Hide Instead of Resurrecting Him?**
- Hide suggested: "Revive me, we'll make more Megamis, call it a success"
- **Kami killed him in fury** - this was the final straw
- Chose to use resurrection on Megami instead
- **Deep regret** for ever trusting Hide

---

### **The Kamigami (His Children):**

**What He Told Them:**
- **EVERYTHING** except Jashin's location and the Ryakujin facility's coordinates
- Told them about Jashin, Megami, Hide, the conspiracy
- Explained Megami leaving **in full detail** - all his sins
- Didn't hide his failures from them

**Why Hide Those Two Things?**
- **Jashin's location:** Too dangerous, didn't want them visiting
- **Ryakujin facility:** Didn't want them exploring their origins

**How He Raised Them:**
- **In his ideology** - taught them Pristania's mission
- **For greatness** - told them they were destined for it
- **Prepared them to lead** - but didn't WANT them as leaders
- **Wanted to find an outside successor** - keep them safe

**Relationship with Each:**
- **Diominiciel (eldest):** *[TBD in their profile]*
- **Hirohiko (middle):** *[TBD in their profile]*
- **Perlereina (youngest):** Especially fond, spoiled her, "daddy's girl"

**His Hope:**
- They'd continue his legacy
- They'd succeed where he failed
- They'd stay safe (contradictory with leading Pristania)

---

### **The 4 Emperors:**

**His Relationship:**
- **Right-hand men** - most devoted followers
- **The chosen** - selected to deliver his ideology to the world
- **Equals (symbolically)** - he served as one of them (actually made them 3)
- Saw them as soldiers AND sons (complicated dynamic)

**Kensuke's Disillusionment:**
- Kensuke was very liberal, valued freedom
- **Saw Pristania forcing righteousness on people**
- This was a travesty to him (good intentions perverted)
- **Left Pristania** before the duel
- Eventually helped raise Meiji to oppose Kami
- Kami likely felt betrayed but understood (deep down)

---

## **SECRETS & GUILT**

### **What He Knew:**
- The full truth about the Ryakujin facility
- He conspired with Hide to kill Jashin
- Jashin is still alive (comatose, sealed)
- Megami's pacifism limitation (she can't kill)
- The location of Jashin's body (Pristania HQ chamber)

### **What He DIDN'T Know:**
- **Meiji's true nature** (Ryakujin weapon designed to kill him)
- **The reincarnation mechanic** (power fragments on death)
- **The resurrection truth** (power dies, not user)
- That his death would create Arjan and Lopney

### **What He Took to His Grave:**
- **Jashin's body location** - only the Kamigami would find it later
- **Full details of Ryakujin experiments** - buried with him
- **His plan to revive Jashin** - never enacted
- **His true feelings about Megami** - did he ever stop loving her?

---

## **CHARACTER ARC**

### **The Tragedy:**
- Started as a kind, obedient experiment
- **Corrupted by jealousy** (Hide's manipulation)
- **Sealed his brother** to "win" Megami
- **Built a life on a lie** (Megami, family, Pristania)
- **Confessed to cleanse himself** (destroyed his family)
- **Doubled down on his mission** (used loss as fuel)
- **Died believing he was right** (never truly learned)

### **The Irony:**
- Wanted to help people - forced them instead
- Wanted to be honest - lived a lie for years
- Wanted to save the world - couldn't save his family
- Wanted absolute morality - broke it when desperate
- Wanted to be a god - died like a man

### **The Question:**
- **Was he a good person?**
- He genuinely wanted to help
- He loved his family deeply
- He sought redemption sincerely
- But he hurt everyone around him
- And he never truly saw his own flaws

---

## **LEGACY**

### **Pristania:**
- Continues his mission (warped by Kamigami's vengeance during war)
- His ideology persists (but is it still "his"?)
- His name is invoked for righteousness AND tyranny

### **The Kamigami:**
- Shaped by his teachings
- Traumatized by his confession
- Burdened by his legacy
- Guard his corpse (the 40%)

### **Arjan & Lopney:**
- Carry fragments of his power
- **Arjan = positive fragment** (looks like him, shares traits)
- **Lopney = negative fragment** (what does this mean?)
- Neither knows their connection to him

### **Meiji:**
- Raised to oppose everything Kami stood for
- Killed him in the duel
- Validated by defeating the "unkillable god"
- Doesn't know he was designed to do exactly that

### **The World:**
- Kami's death sparked a 3-year war
- His vision is still debated (Pristania vs. Free)
- His name means different things to different people
- Hero? Tyrant? Tragic idealist?

---

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

### **What Kami Represents:**
- **The road to hell paved with good intentions**
- **Authoritarianism disguised as compassion**
- **The danger of absolute conviction**
- **A broken man trying to fix a broken world (and breaking it further)**

### **Is He Sympathetic?**
- **Yes** - his intentions were genuine
- He truly believed he was helping
- He loved deeply (Megami, his children)
- He sought redemption sincerely
- His flaws were human (jealousy, pride, self-deception)

**But also:**
- He hurt everyone he loved
- He refused to see his own tyranny
- He justified terrible acts for "the greater good"
- He died without learning his lesson

### **The Central Tragedy:**
- Kami had the power to change the world
- But he tried to FORCE change, not inspire it
- He could have been a true savior
- Instead, he became a cautionary tale

---

## **RELATIONSHIP TO ARJAN**

### **The Positive Fragment:**
- Arjan inherited 30% of Kami's power
- **Physical resemblance:** Same build, same facial structure, small circles under eyes
- **Personality echoes:** Selfless, protective, loving
- **Flaw inheritance:** Conflict avoidance, martyr complex, naive idealism

### **The Question:**
- Will Arjan learn from Kami's mistakes?
- Or is he doomed to repeat them?
- Can he be the hero Kami wanted to be but failed to become?

### **The Hope:**
- Arjan has what Kami lacked: humility, willingness to listen
- Arjan doesn't see himself as a savior (yet)
- Arjan's conflict avoidance could protect him from Kami's authoritarianism
- But it could also make him passive when action is needed

---
