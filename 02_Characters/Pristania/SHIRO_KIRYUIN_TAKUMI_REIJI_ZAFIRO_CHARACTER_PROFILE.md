## **THE DUAL EXISTENCE - CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**

### **How Shiro's Possession Works:**

**Three Bodies, One Soul:**

1. **Shiro's Original Body (鬼龍院四郎):**
   - Still alive but soulless
   - Hidden in Pristania, kept in Diominiciel's preservation machine
   - Automatically nourished, excretion retrieved
   - Heart still pumping, body aging normally
   - Immobile and stiff when Shiro possesses other bodies
   - Shiro can return his soul here at will

2. **Reiji's Body (巧怜志) - Primary Vessel:**
   - Deceased 18 years ago (ship explosion)
   - Shiro's soul reanimates the corpse
   - Body functions normally (needs food, ages, etc.)
   - Dead person's mind does NOT return
   - Shiro controls it completely
   - **This is "Zafiro" to Pristania members**

3. **Kensuke's Body (Arc 2 only):**
   - Possessed 5 years ago during attack
   - Used to infiltrate Free as their president
   - Stops possessing end of Arc 2
   - Returns to Reiji's body

**Voice & Appearance:**
- **Voice:** When possessing someone, Shiro sounds like THAT PERSON (vocal cords, not soul)
- **Appearance:** Looks like the body he's inhabiting
- **Personality:** Intentionally adopted Reiji's personality to honor him

**The Process:**
- Shiro's soul leaves his original body → possesses target
- Original body becomes immobile (but alive)
- Target body is controlled by Shiro's consciousness
- Can return to original body at will
- While possessing corpse: reanimates functions but no pain from wounds

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **NOURYOKU: SOUL POSSESSION (鬼龍院 Kiryuin Family Ability)**

**Ability Name:** [Unnamed - Kiryuin family power]
**Nature:** Transfer consciousness/soul to possess objects and beings

---

### **How It Works:**

**The Soul:**
- Shiro has a **Soul** (consciousness/existence)
- Can **transfer Soul** from original body to other targets
- **Original body** becomes immobile but alive when Soul leaves
- Can **return to original body** at will
- **Short range transfer** - must be close to target

**While Possessing:**
- Shiro's consciousness controls target
- Can move, speak, use target's abilities
- Original body remains alive but soulless
- Can stay in possessed target indefinitely
- Must maintain possessed body (food, aging, etc.)

---

### **STAGE 1 - BASE ABILITY (Before Evolution):**

**What He Could Do:**
- Possess **small inanimate objects** only
- Move objects at will (make them float)
- Do funny tricks with objects
- **Talk through possessed objects**
- Short range transfer

**Limitations:**
- Only small objects
- One object at a time
- No living beings
- No large objects

**Shiro's Development:**
- Developed this ability **late** (age 15-16)
- Why Goro abused him - thought he'd be "weak link"
- Finally manifested before fleeing home

---

### **STAGE 2 - EVOLVED ABILITY (After Ship Explosion):**

**Trigger:**
- **Near-death experience** during ship explosion
- Reiji died shielding him
- Shiro nearly died
- **Evolved subconsciously** to survive

**What He Can Do Now:**

**1. Possess Any Inanimate Object:**
- No size limit (small box → entire car)
- Can possess multiple objects simultaneously
- Environment becomes his weapon

**2. Possess Living Beings:**
- **Requirement:** Target must be **near death**
- Cannot possess healthy living person
- Once possessed: host remains dormant but alive
- Shiro controls body completely
- **Gains access to target's Nouryoku** (if they have one)

**3. Corpse Possession (Special Case):**
- Can possess dead bodies
- Shiro's Soul **reanimates basic functions**
  - Heart pumps, lungs breathe
  - Body needs food, ages normally
  - Bodily functions continue
- **Dead person's mind does NOT return**
- **No pain from wounds** (nervous system inactive in corpse)
- Even mutilated corpse can function
- Must maintain the body or it decays

**Current Status:**
- **Permanently possessing Reiji's corpse** (18 years)
- Reiji's body kept alive by Shiro's Soul
- Ages normally, needs food
- Fully functional despite being technically dead
- Reiji's mind never returned - only Shiro

---

### **COMBAT STYLE:**

**Philosophy:**
- **Use environment as weapon**
- Very imaginative and creative
- Hide original body somewhere safe
- Fight through possessed objects/beings

**Tactics:**

**Environmental Possession:**
- Possess box of knives → pierce enemy's skin
- Possess car → run over opponent
- Possess floor → make it shake/collapse
- Possess weapons → attack from unexpected angles
- Possess multiple small objects → swarm attack

**With Diominiciel's Tech:**
- Diominiciel creates **specialized devices for Shiro**
- Shiro possesses tech to use it
- Combines invention with possession
- Unique synergy between Apostle and master

**Body Safety:**
- **Physical body usually hidden** during combat
- Cannot risk original body being damaged
- If possessed body damaged: retains pain and injuries
- If possessed corpse damaged: no pain (nervous system dead)

**Assassin Training:**
- **Did receive training** from Goro
- **Seldom uses it** - prefers possession tactics
- Has the skills but different approach than Ichiro
- Can fight hand-to-hand if needed

**Strengths:**
- Incredibly versatile
- Environment is always on his side
- Hard to predict attacks
- Can possess opponent's weapons
- Imaginative solutions

**Weaknesses:**
- Original body vulnerable if found
- Must be near target to possess
- Living beings must be near-death first
- If all possessed objects destroyed, must flee
- Relies on environment (bad in empty spaces)
