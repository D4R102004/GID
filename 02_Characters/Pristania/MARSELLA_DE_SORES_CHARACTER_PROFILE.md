- Malevolence wins over potential redemption

**Phase 4 - The Outcome:**
- **Yonoa loses the battle**
- Gravely injured by Marsella

- Still belittling even after everything

**Critical Research (Arc 5):**

- Uses genetic and biological analysis
- Scientific expertise applied to mystery

**The Discovery:**
- **Deduces their Kami power nature**
- Discovers resurrection ability mechanics
- **Realizes they are Kami's reincarnations**
- 30% each, 40% in corpse = 100% total

**The Report:**
- **Tells the Kamigami siblings** about discovery
- Provides scientific evidence
- Explains what Arjan and Lopney truly are
- **Crucial plot revelation** enabled by her brilliance

**Importance:**
- This discovery changes everything
- Pristania now knows Kami can be restored
- Sets up Arc 6 conflicts
- Marsella's scientific skills prove invaluable

### **Arc 6: Redemption Through Lyon**

**Status:** Alive, still works at Pristania

**Character Arc:**
