## **VOICE & DIALOGUE**

### **Speech Patterns:**
- **Calm, analytical** - speaks like a scientist or executive
- **Methodical explanations** - precise language, clear logic
- **Reserved warmth** - shows affection subtly (with family)
- **Pragmatic directness** - no flowery language, gets to the point
- **Strategic commands** - military precision when leading

### **Sample Dialogue:**

**To Zafiro (his Apostle and friend):**
> "You're going to do it or not? I'll let you do it your way, old friend."
> *(Trusting, gives autonomy, values friendship beneath command)*

**Discovering Perlereina and Glayne's romance (Perlereina hugs him):**
> "Seems I got here at the best part. Good to see you, Glayne."
> *(Warm, supportive, accepting - shows his caring side)*

**To Vista Alegre Police Chief (executing him):**
> "You've crossed the threshold, and a terrible one. This is for my father."
> *(Final, pragmatic, merciless - no emotion, just execution)*

**Strategic planning with Perlereina:**
> "We need to analyze their movements before striking. Rushing in will cost us more than patience."
> *(Measured, reasonable, trying to temper her impulsiveness)*

**In the laboratory (to himself or assistants):**
> "The energy readings are consistent. If I can stabilize the output, the necklace should amplify the effect by 40%."
> *(Scientist mode - analytical, focused, precise)*

**Reprimanding Perlereina (protective but firm):**
> "You cannot keep charging into battle without a plan. I won't lose you too."
> *(Concern masked as logic, family love beneath strategy)*

### **Verbal Habits:**
- Uses scientific terminology naturally
- Refers to Perlereina as "sister" or "Paru" (affectionate)
- Calls Zafiro "old friend" (warmth despite formality)
- Analytical phrasing ("the data suggests," "logically speaking")
- Rarely raises voice (calm even when angry)
- Precise word choice (scientist's precision)

---

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Time Flow Manipulation**

**Nickname:** Dyoni

**Core Ability:**
- **Manipulates the flow of time** in his vicinity
- **Slows time to near-stop** for everyone except himself
- Functions like "lowering the volume" of time
- Can move freely while time crawls for others
- **Duration:** Limited (exact length TBD - minutes? Seconds?)
- **Range:** Area around him (size TBD)

**Intangibility Mechanic:**
- **Cannot touch others or objects** while time is slowed
- His being becomes intangible during activation
- **Exception:** If part of his body (like blood on his fist) acts as intermediary
  - Example: Fist covered in his own blood can punch
  - The blood bridges the gap between his intangible state and target
- **Strategic implication:** Must wound himself slightly to attack directly

**Enhanced Strikes:**
- Punches delivered during slowed time carry **immense force**
- Time manipulation amplifies impact strength
- Single blow can devastate opponents
- Combines physics of time distortion with combat

---

### **Time Energy Necklace:**

**Discovery:**
- Diominiciel discovered that slowing time **releases energy**
- Time flow manipulation generates measurable power output
- This energy can be harvested and stored

**The Necklace:**
- Worn around his neck constantly
- **Stores time-released energy** from his ability usage
- Can **shoot massive wave of energy** as projectile attack
- Devastating offensive capability
- Recharged through his power usage

**Tactical Application:**
- Use time slow to position and build charge
- Fire energy wave from necklace
- Massive area-of-effect damage
- Strategic trump card in battle

---

### **Fighting Style:**

**Philosophy:**
- **Minimal investment, maximum efficiency** - finish quickly and cleanly
- **Strategic positioning** - use time slow to gain advantage
- **Avoidance of direct combat** - not a martial artist, uses intellect
- **Assassination approach** - sneaks behind enemies, KOs from stealth

**Tactics:**
- Activate time slow (enemies freeze)
- Position behind or beside target
- Wound himself slightly (blood on fist)
- Strike with time-amplified punch (devastating force)
- Alternatively: Fire necklace energy wave (ranged devastation)
- Escape or reposition before time resumes

**Combat Comparison:**
- Similar to **King Crimson** from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
- Time manipulation + positioning advantage
- Enemy doesn't see attack coming (moved during frozen time)
- Appears teleporting or phasing to observers

**Non-Combat Use:**
- **Escape:** Slow time, walk away while enemies can't react
- **Infiltration:** Move through secured areas undetected
- **Research:** Slow time to extend working hours
- **Surveillance:** Observe situations without being noticed

**Weaknesses:**
- **Not skilled in martial arts** - relies on tech and powers
- **Intangibility limits offense** - must use blood trick or necklace
- **Time limit on ability** - can't maintain forever
- **Preparation required** - needs to wound self for direct strikes
- **Vulnerable if caught before activation** - average physical build

---

### **The Hirohiko Incident:**

**How Their Powers Combined:**
- **Diominiciel slowed time** around Hirohiko
- **Perlereina used portals** during the frozen moment
- **Combined effect:** Temporal-spatial trauma
  - Time distortion + portal displacement = severe brain damage
  - Induced coma and memory loss
  - Unintentional consequence of combined assault

**Why Imprisonment:**
- Diominiciel suggested **hiding Hirohiko** to:
  1. Keep him safe from further harm
  2. Research a way to restore his memories
  3. Return him to normal once healed
- Was working on memory restoration when Hirohiko escaped
- Imprisonment was protective, not punitive (in his mind)

---

- **Family should be united** - conflict between them is wrong
- **Wanted to fix it** - memory restoration as redemption
- **Failure haunts him** - couldn't save his brother

---

### **Megami/Rajin (His Mother - Abandoned Them):**

**What He Remembers:**
- **Age 7 when she left** - old enough for clear memories
- **Loving mother** during childhood
- **The Kamigami who knew her best** - most exposure to her
- Warm, caring presence in early years

**After She Left:**
- **Kami told the full story** - Jashin, betrayal, confession
- **Felt abandoned** - "No reason to leave your children"
- **Conflicted feelings:**
  - Knows Kami acted wrong
  - Still believes leaving was unforgivable
  - Understands her pain intellectually
  - Resents her emotionally

**Current Feelings:**

- Dead by this point
- His sacrifice and death have lasting impact
- His technology may still function (units, systems)

---

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

### **What Diominiciel Represents:**

1. **The Divided Man:**
   - Caught between siblings' ideologies (Perlereina's war, Hirohiko's peace)
   - Knows what they're doing is wrong
   - Does it anyway (pragmatism over principles)
   - Internal conflict he never resolves

2. **Wasted Potential:**
   - **Bright future** in scientific community
   - **Chose revenge** instead of innovation for good
   - Could've been great humanitarian scientist
   - Became weapons developer for war

3. **The Broken Intellectual:**
   - Intelligence doesn't prevent moral failure
   - Logic used to justify terrible choices
   - Analysis paralysis leads to enabling evil
   - Smart enough to know better, too conflicted to change

4. **Responsibility and Duty:**
   - **Family comes first** - even when wrong
   - **Must do what's necessary** - pragmatic sacrifice
   - **Eldest son burden** - carries siblings' weight
   - **Duty to legacy** - serves dead father's memory

5. **The Reserved Mourner:**
   - Grief buried in work
   - Emotions suppressed through science
   - Laboratory as escape from pain
   - Never truly processes loss (unlike Perlereina's open rage)

---

### **Contrast with Perlereina:**

**Perlereina:**
- **Fanatically devoted** to Kami
- **Emotional, impulsive** - acts on feeling
- **Wants Meiji to suffer** - cruelty as justice
- **Hates all of Free** - total war mindset
- **Openly grieves** - rage visible, consuming

**Diominiciel:**
- **Values Kami** but more reserved
- **Analytical, methodical** - acts on logic
- **Wants Meiji dead** - clean execution
- **Targets only Meiji** - pragmatic vengeance
- **Suppresses grief** - buries pain in work

**Together They Form:**
- **Emotion + Logic** - heart and mind of Pristania
- **Passion + Pragmatism** - complete leadership
- **War + Strategy** - tactics and execution
- **Balance** - neither could lead alone effectively

---

### **His Ideology:**

**Absolute Morality:**
- **Genuine belief** in Kami's vision
- **Internal conflict:** "Is this what father wanted?"
- **Pragmatic justification:** "It's for the greater good"
- **Fights to the end** despite doubts

**On Nouryoku:**
- **Researches them scientifically** - mechanics, not mysticism
- Powers are phenomena to study and understand
- How he invented time energy necklace
- Views abilities as tools, not destiny

**The Contradiction:**
- Believes in righteousness
- Commits terrible acts
- Knows he's gone too far
- Continues anyway (family + revenge)
- Dies enabling his sister's final stand

---

## **SECRETS & KNOWLEDGE**

### **What Diominiciel Knows:**
- Full truth about Kami, Jashin, Megami (Kami told all three siblings)
- Pristania's complete operations and structure
- Kami's corpse location and research (guards it, studies it)
- **Percentage is missing** from corpse (60% present, 40% gone)
- Zafiro's true identity (Shiro Kiryuin - only he knows)
- Hirohiko's memory loss cause (combined power trauma)
- Free's general operations and ideology

### **What Diominiciel DOESN'T Know:**
- **Arjan and Lopney exist** and have the missing 40%
- **Rajin is Megami** (his mother is in Free)
- **Rajin raised Meiji** (mother helped create father's killer)
- **Meiji is Ryakujin weapon** (designed to kill Kami)
- **Hirohiko's current location** (searched, failed to find)
- **Free HQ location** (island cliffs)
- **Glayne's vendetta** against Gallan (Perlereina keeps it secret)

### **What the AUDIENCE Knows (That Diominiciel Doesn't):**
- His mother betrayed the family twice (left them, raised Meiji)
- The missing power is in two teenagers he's never heard of
- His death will give Perlereina god-tier power
- His sacrifice won't be enough (she still loses)
- Meiji was literally programmed to kill Kami
