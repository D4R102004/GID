- **No filler words** - speaks clearly despite being casual
- Optimistic even in bad situations (sometimes forced optimism when scared)

### **Sample Dialogue:**

**Defusing an argument:**
> "No, but that's not the point. I'm talking about this..."
> *(Redirects rather than confronts)*

**Comforting Lopney:**
> "Come here. Don't worry, Lo. I'm with you. I'll always be."
> *(Physical affection + reassurance, uses nickname "Lo")*

**Scared but trying to be brave:**
> "I don't believe y-you. Once my friends are here they'll tear you up. You j-just wait."
> *(Stutter betrays fear, but still threatens on behalf of others, not himself)*

### **Verbal Habits:**
- Goes by nickname **"Fer"**
- Uses "Lo" as Lopney's nickname
- Calls Gallan "Dad" (or equivalent)
- Direct statements: "I'm with you" rather than "I'll try to help"
- Optimistic framing: "Everything's okay" vs. "Things aren't terrible"

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Energy Sphere Manipulation**

**Mechanics:**
- Conjures energy spheres from his hands
- Can spawn spheres within 2-meter range
- Once created, spheres can be manipulated at any distance
- Can control size, movement, placement
- Can detonate spheres (controlled burst, precision damage)
- Can pre-place spheres as traps
- No hard limit on number, but extreme fatigue reduces output

**Advanced Technique - Sphere Encapsulation:**
- Can trap objects/attacks inside his spheres
- **Power Nullification Effect:** Anything encapsulated loses connection to external powers
  - Example: Yurisha's controlled papers become inert when trapped
  - The sphere cuts off the power user's control over the encapsulated object
- **Discovery:** Arjan doesn't know this ability exists at Arc 1 start
- **First Use:** Discovered mid-fight against Yurisha (instinctive defense)
- **Limitations:**
  - Requires precise timing to catch fast-moving objects
  - Sphere must fully enclose the target
  - Living beings can still move/act inside (just lose power connection)

**Sensory Experience:**
- Doesn't tire him mentally, but **requires focus** to generate
- Feels like "suddenly holding control of things around you"
- Loss of focus = spheres destabilize

**Named Techniques:**
- *(He doesn't name them, but we can create technique names for dramatic effect in narration/battle shouts)*
- Potential names: **"Orbit,"** **"Detonation,"** **"Cage,"** **"Barrage"**

### **Combat Philosophy:**
- **Tolerates combat, doesn't enjoy it**
- Can feel fear of opponents but recognizes advantages and exploits them
- Feels justified hurting someone in defense, **but never fatally**
- Prefers non-lethal takedowns

### **Fighting Style:**
- **Role:** Tank/Distraction
- **Strategy:** Creates sphere zones to control battlefield
- **Teamwork:** Works in tandem with Lopney (he baits/tanks, she finishes)
- **Tactics:**
  - Pre-placed sphere traps
  - Orbital defense (spheres circling him)
  - Detonation barrages for area denial
  - Uses his body as bait (martyr complex in action)
  - **Sphere Encapsulation** (discovered in Arc 1): Traps enemy attacks/weapons to nullify them
