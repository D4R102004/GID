**Status:** Founder and leader of Free, Kami's killer, Ryakujin weapon (unaware)

---

## **NAME SIGNIFICANCE**

**Meiji (芽生二):**
- **"Second Sprout"** - hints at his nature as a contingency, a backup plan
- He knows the meaning of his name
- Ironic: named for new growth, but created as a weapon
- Does he ever wonder WHY he was named this?

**Psycho (最高):**
- Nickname based on his psychokinesis ability
- **"Supreme"** - fitting for someone who defeated a god
- The dual meaning works: psychic powers + supreme achievement

---

## **PERSONALITY CORE**

### **Defining Traits:**
1. **Guilt-ridden victor** - regrets killing Kami despite ideological victory
2. **Emotional but reserved** - feels deeply, speaks little
3. **Charismatic leader** - inspires through example, not words
4. **Self-deprecating martyr** - sees himself as unworthy, others as better
5. **Tragic idealist** - believes in free will while being a programmed weapon (unknowingly)

### **Core Values:**
- **Human free will** - absolute conviction that choice matters
- **Equality** - everyone has potential to make the world better
- **Acknowledgment of difference** - welcomes diversity, not uniformity
- **Personal responsibility** - bad choices have consequences, but humans can improve
- **Peace** - desperately wants to avoid more conflict

### **Fatal Flaws:**
- **Crushing guilt** - can't forgive himself for Kami's death or the war
- **Self-isolation** - withdraws from those who care about him
- **Martyr complex** - believes he deserves to suffer for what he's done
- **Hidden instability** - the Ryakujin programming creates unconscious volatility

### **Dual Nature:**

**As a Leader:**
- Serious, formal, commanding
- Inspirational figure through actions, not speeches
- Respectful to followers
- Decisive about his beliefs

**In Private:**
- Warm (with loved ones)
- Cold and distant (default state)
- Seeks comfort from Rajin when feeling down
- Can be casual with boyfriend and adopted son

### **What Drives Him:**
- **Primary:** Maintaining peace (prevent another war)
- **Secondary:** Proving humans have agency (his ideology)
- **Personal:** Protecting those he loves (boyfriend, son, friends, Rajin)
- **Hidden:** Redeeming himself for Kami's death (impossible task)

### **What Makes Him Happy:**
- His boyfriend (romantic love)
- His adopted son (paternal pride)
- His friends (genuine connections)
- Rare moments of peace
- When his ideology seems validated

### **What Haunts Him:**
- **Kami's death** - the moment he became a killer
- **The war** - colleagues dying under his command
- **The Kamigami** - orphaning Kami's children
- **Rajin's grief** - thinking she's ashamed of him
- **His own existence** - feeling like a mistake, a catalyst for suffering

---

## **VOICE & DIALOGUE**

### **Speech Patterns:**
- **Very few words** - speaks only when necessary
- **Serious tone** - calm, measured, authoritative
- **Can speak passionately** when proving his point (rare)
- **Formal** with most people, casual only with intimates
- **Inspires confidence** through voice and presence

### **How He Addresses People:**
- Kensuke: "Father" or "父上" (formal, not "Dad")
- Rajin: "Mother" (seeks her comfort)
- Followers: Respectful, formal
- Boyfriend/Son: More casual, warmer
- Enemies: Cold, factual

### **Sample Dialogue:**

**Challenging Kami publicly (before the duel):**
> "You do not represent the absolute. We humans have it in ourselves to make the world a better place, not you alone."
> *(Confident, ideological, declaring war on authoritarianism)*

**During the duel (proving himself):**
> "I can prove myself, and I shall."
> *(Determined, focused, no doubt)*

**After Kami's death:**
> *[Speechless. Shocked. Stands over the body in horror.]*
> *(The weight of what he's done crashes down - no words can capture it)*

### **Verbal Patterns:**
- Remarks on facts about the world (observational)
- Silent leader (actions > words)
- Contrasts with Kami's prepotent, preachy style
- When he does speak, people listen (rarity = weight)

---

## **IDEOLOGY - "FREE WILL"**

### **Core Beliefs:**
- **Humans should choose how they live** (not be forced into morality)
- **Bad choices have consequences** - but that's how we learn
- **Equality** - everyone has it inside them to make the world better
- **Diversity of thought** - differences should be welcomed, not crushed
- **Collective improvement** - if everyone tries, the world gets better

### **How It Differs From Kami:**
- **Kami:** Forces morality, imposes righteousness, demands uniformity
- **Meiji:** Allows choice, accepts consequences, welcomes difference
- **Kami:** "I alone can save the world"
- **Meiji:** "We all have it in us to make things better"

### **Does He Believe Humans Are Good?**
- Not inherently - acknowledges humans make bad choices
- But believes everyone has the **capacity** for good
- Choice is what matters, not forced righteousness
- Optimistic humanism despite his personal despair

### **The Tragic Irony:**
- Fights for free will while being a weapon (unknowingly)
- His beliefs are genuine, but his existence was calculated
- Does this invalidate his ideology? Or prove it (he chose despite programming)?

---

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Psychokinesis**

**Core Abilities:**
- **Telekinesis** - move objects/people with his mind
- **Levitation** - self and others
- **Psionic energy manipulation** - can manifest psychic force
- **Mental attacks** - can affect people's minds directly
- **Flight** - levitates himself naturally

**Power Level:**
- **Top 3 in GID** - incredibly powerful
- Range: Very long (not kilometers, but extensive)
- Can affect multiple targets simultaneously
- Example: Levitate and throw dozens of rocks at once

**Limitations:**
- **Requires concentration** - needs focus to use powers
- **Mental fatigue** - extended use drains him
- Not invincible despite strength

**Combat Applications:**
- Fly around battlefield for positioning
- Manipulate opponents (throw them, crash them into ground)
- Hurl environmental objects (rocks, debris) as weapons
- Engulf himself in psychic energy and charge like a missile
- Attack minds directly (disorientation, pain, confusion)

---

### **The Ryakujin Contingency:**

**True Nature (Unknown to Meiji):**
- Hidden programming designed to kill Kami/Jashin
- Activates when detecting god-tier powers (Kami's or Jashin's specifically)
- Makes him a **perfect counter** to the gods he was built to destroy

**Activation Trigger:**
- Detects Kami's or Jashin's power signature
- **Will activate against Arjan/Lopney** (they carry Kami's fragments)
- **Will activate against Perlereina** (if she absorbs Kami's 40%)

**Transformation:**
- **Wings** sprout from his back
- **Eyes** gain distinctive marking/glow
- **Hands** turn into claws
- **Feet** become eagle talons
- **Snake tail** emerges
- **Chimera form** - hybrid beast designed to kill gods

**Power Boost:**
- **Massively stronger** - overpowers Kami "absurdly easily"
- **Faster** - speed advantage overwhelming
- **More powerful** - abilities amplified
- **Greater range** - psychic reach extends
- **Enhanced resistance** - harder to damage

**Meiji's Experience:**
- **Conscious** during transformation
- **Doesn't understand** what's happening
- Attributes it to "developing new powers" or "adrenaline rush"
- Somewhat **unstable** due to programming conflict
- First activation: During Kami duel (age 16)
- Never activated before that moment
- Doesn't know how to trigger it intentionally

**What He Thinks:**
- Just a hidden aspect of his ability awakening under pressure
- Proof of his potential/growth
- Doesn't question it deeply (too focused on ideology)

---

### **Fighting Style:**

**Philosophy:**
- **Sees combat as necessary evil** - doesn't enjoy it
- Prefers to avoid conflict if possible
- When forced to fight, fights to win quickly

**Tactics:**
- Highly mobile (flight + levitation)
- Manipulates battlefield and opponents
- Uses environment creatively (hurl everything)
- Mental attacks to disorient/disable
- Psychic energy charges for devastating impact
- **Effortless, focused** vs. Kami's overwhelming spam

**Strengths:**
- Versatility (telekinesis has endless applications)
- Mobility (flight gives positioning advantage)
- Range (keeps distance, controls space)
- Creativity (thinks tactically, adapts)

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires concentration (can be disrupted)
- Mental fatigue from extended combat
- Emotional instability (guilt affects performance)
- Contingency transformation is involuntary (can't control it)

---

## **KEY RELATIONSHIPS**

### **Rajin/Megami (His Adoptive Mother):**

**What He Knows:**
- She found him as a baby in Ryakujin facility ruins
- She raised him with Kensuke
- She taught him to oppose Kami
- She's a member of Free
- **Does NOT know:** She is Megami (Kami's ex-wife, mother of the Kamigami)

**Their Dynamic:**
- **He loves her deeply** - sees her as his go-to when feeling down
- **She is emotionally detached** - he notices this
- **Post-Kami's death:** Rajin experienced sudden grief (emptiness after revenge)
- **Meiji's interpretation:** Thinks she's ashamed her son is a murderer
- **The truth:** She mourns for the Kamigami (her abandoned children, now fatherless)

**His Dependence:**
- Seeks her comfort when struggling
- Values her opinion deeply
- Worries about her detachment but doesn't push
- **Would be devastated** to learn she's Megami

---

### **Kensuke (His Adoptive Father/Mentor):**

**What He Knows:**
- Kensuke was a Pristania 4 Emperor who defected
- Kensuke became disillusioned with Kami's authoritarianism
- Kensuke co-founded Free with him (age 15)
- Kensuke helped shape his ideology through real-life examples

**Their Dynamic:**
- **Formal relationship:** Calls him "Father" or "父上" (not "Dad")
- **Ideological alignment:** Kensuke taught him everything
- **Post-Kami's death:**
  - Kensuke was **delighted** when Meiji killed Kami
  - Meiji **regrets it** (orphaning the Kamigami)
  - This creates tension: Kensuke celebrates, Meiji grieves
- **Current relationship:** Complicated (will be explored in story)

**Kensuke's Influence:**
- Shaped Meiji's entire worldview
- Taught him to hate Kami explicitly
- Encouraged the duel
- Matched the Kamigami's brutality during the war (more ruthless than Meiji)

---

### **How He Was Raised:**

**The Explicit Goal:**
- Rajin and Kensuke **wanted revenge**
- They **plotted everything** - raising Meiji to oppose Kami
- **Explicit teachings:** "Kami is wrong, here's why"
- Not subtle - they actively cultivated his opposition

**What This Means:**
- Meiji's ideology was **taught**, not discovered
- His hatred of Kami was **manufactured** by his parents
- His challenge to Kami was **engineered**
- But does that make his beliefs less genuine?

**The Irony:**
- Raised to fight for free will
- But his entire purpose was designed by others
- Ryakujin made him a weapon
- Rajin/Kensuke made him a revolutionary
- Does Meiji have free will, or is he the ultimate puppet?

---

### **Cristopher (Rachi - Secret Boyfriend):**

**The Secret Relationship:**
- **Together for 5 years** (started after Pristania attack 5 years ago)
- **Completely secret** - only Lyzander knows (deduced it through investigation)
- Not even Kensuke or Rajin are aware
- They don't hang out publicly as a couple (some closeness but nobody notices)

**How It Started:**
- After the tragedy 5 years ago (Gabriella's capture, children's deaths)
- Meiji was emotionally devastated, isolated in his grief
- **Cristopher became his refuge** - physical comfort became relationship
- Started as escape from pain, developed into genuine feelings

**Meiji's Side:**
- Finds refuge from his crushing guilt in Cristopher
- **All caring and a bit silly** with him (rare moments of lightness)
- Calls him **"Crissty"** (affectionate nickname Cristopher hates)
- Wants intimacy beyond sex - cuddling, movies, ice cream dates at Delicya's
- Loves him, but "in a somewhat childish way"
- Acts "too all-knowing" sometimes (frustrates Cristopher)
- **Bottom** in the sexual dynamic

**What He Wants:**
- Emotional connection, romance, normalcy
- Someone who sees him as just Meiji, not the god-killer or president
- To feel something other than grief

**The Complication:**
- Cristopher keeps pushing him away emotionally
- Wants "just sex" while Meiji wants more
- Meiji's childish affection clashes with Cristopher's need for distance
- Their relationship is stuck in limbo (neither fully together nor apart)

**Arc 4 - The Devastating Loss:**
- **Cristopher is captured saving Arjan from Perlereina**
- **Meiji witnesses his death** (in front of him)
- **One of the saddest moments in the story**
- Compounds his existing grief (Kami, the war, now Cristopher)

**Cristopher's Death:**
- **Loses his boyfriend in this arc**
- Cristopher is catured saving Arjan from Perlereina
- **Meiji witnesses the death** (happens in front of him)
- One of the most devastating moments in his life
---

- He values them deeply

**His Best Friend:**
- **Secluded from each other for 15 years** (story-relevant mystery)

- This separation weighs on Meiji

---

### **Free's Members:**

**How He Leads:**
- **By example** - lives his ideology, doesn't just preach
- **Respectful** - treats followers as equals
- **Inspirational figure** - his presence, charisma, and good looks charm people
- **Formal but caring** - maintains distance but genuinely cares

**Their View of Him:**
- Hero who killed a god

- Living proof that humans can challenge tyrants
- Tragic figure burdened by his own victory

---

### **The Kamigami (Kami's Children - His Unknowing Step-Siblings):**

**What He Knows:**
- They exist (Kami's three children)
- They want him dead (revenge for their father)
- They lead Pristania now
- **Does NOT know:** Rajin is their mother (making them his step-siblings)

**His Feelings:**
- **Deep regret** for orphaning them
- Wishes he could undo killing Kami
- Would try to plead with them if they met
- Knows they'll never forgive him

**If They Met:**
- **Fierce battle would ensue** (they want him dead)
- **He would try to plead** (explain, apologize, reason)
- **They would not listen** (blinded by grief/vengeance)
- **Tragic confrontation** - no resolution possible

**The Hidden Truth:**
- They're his step-siblings through Rajin
- If he knew, it would compound his guilt
- If they knew, it would complicate their hatred
- Rajin's secret keeps this truth buried

---

## **THE DUEL & ITS AFTERMATH**

### **Before the Duel:**

**Mental State:**
- **Confident** - ready to prove himself and his ideology
- **Determined** - this is his moment
- **Hopeful** - expected to win, expected validation

**Rajin's Reaction:**
- Tried to stop him initially
- Eventually supported him (couldn't deny him his purpose)
- Feared losing him but respected his choice

**Kensuke's Reaction:**
- **Delighted** - this is what they raised him for
- Encouraged and supported fully
- Saw it as the culmination of their plan

**Meiji's Goals:**
- Prove ideological superiority (free will > forced morality)
- Make a statement to the world
- Validate his parents' teachings
- **Didn't expect:** The emotional cost of victory

---

### **During the Duel:**

**Opening:**
- Kami dominated (veteran experience, god-tier power)
- Meiji was losing badly
- Struggled to keep up

**Contingency Activation:**
- **Trigger:** Detected Kami's god-tier power signature
- **Transformation:** Wings, claws, talons, tail, eye markings
- **Meiji's experience:** Felt **powerful**, didn't question it
- **Too focused** on winning to analyze what was happening
- **Unstable** due to programming conflict (fighting on instinct)

**The Shift:**
- Suddenly overpowering Kami
- Everything became easier, faster, stronger
- Winning felt inevitable

**The Killing Blow:**
- Final clash
- Kami fell dead
- **Meiji's mind:** **Shock** - "I can't believe it. What have I done?"
- **Immediate feeling:** Horror, emptiness, grief
- **Realization:** "This is very bad. This is something I'll regret forever."

---

### **After Kami's Death:**

**Immediate Aftermath:**
- Speechless, frozen over Kami's body
- **Horror and emptiness** - victory feels like defeat
- **Didn't expect it at all** - thought he'd feel triumph, feels only guilt

**Transformation of Personality:**
- Became **sadder, more isolated**
- **Resented** - by himself, by some in Free
- **Seclusive** - withdrew from public life
- Lost his confident charisma, gained haunted demeanor

**Rajin's Grief:**
- Meiji noticed her sudden emotional detachment
- **He thinks:** She's ashamed he's a murderer
- **Truth:** She mourns the Kamigami (her abandoned children, now orphans)
- Rajin doesn't explain - lets him think it's about him
- This compounds his guilt

**Power Fragmentation:**
- Kami's power split: 30% Arjan, 30% Lopney, 40% corpse
- Meiji doesn't know this happened
- Doesn't know Kami's "successors" exist

---

## **THE 3-YEAR WAR**

### **His Role:**

**As Leader (Age 17-20):**
- **Reluctant participant** - didn't want war
- **Witnessed colleagues die** - people he cared about
- **Commanded forces** - many died under his orders
- **Didn't match Kamigami's brutality** - tried to stay "moral"
- **Still committed murder** - no clean hands in war

**Kensuke's Role:**
- **Matched the Kamigami's brutality** - more ruthless than Meiji
- Fought viciously for Free
- Celebrated the conflict (revenge fulfilled)
- Contrast: Father enjoyed war, son hated it

**The Toll:**
- Shaped Meiji into someone who **despises conflict**
- **Hates war** - saw its true cost
- **Hates himself** - caused all this death
- Became **sad, hardened, distant, anguished**

**What He Regrets:**
- Starting the conflict (his duel triggered the war)
- Every death under his command
- Not finding peace sooner
- The Kamigami's suffering

---

### **The Treaty:**

**Why He Signed:**
- **Wanted it to end** - couldn't bear more death
- **Rajin's influence** - she pushed for peace
- **War-weariness** - exhausted, traumatized
- **Realization:** Ideology doesn't matter if everyone's dead

**How He Sees It:**
- **Good that it stopped** - peace is worth compromise
- **Not defeat** - both sides survived
- **Not victory** - too much was lost
- **Necessary** - the only way forward

---

## **CURRENT STATE (ARC 1 - 15 Years Post-War)**

### **Personality Now:**

**Outward:**
- **Hermit** - withdrawn, reclusive
- **Distant** - keeps emotional walls up
- **Serious** - rarely smiles, always burdened
- **Leader** - still commands Free, but from shadows

**Inward:**
- **Being in pain** - constant guilt and regret
- **Managed some happiness** - boyfriend, son, friends help
- **Never recovered** from Kami's death
- **Sees peace as impossible** given Pristania/Free tension

**Daily Life:**
- **Secludes in his room** when not needed
- **Seeks loved ones** when feeling lowest
- **Maintains Free** but delegates much
- **Remains hidden** to prevent war restarting

---

### **His Goals:**

**Primary:**
- **Maintain peace** - avoid triggering another war
- **Protect Free** - keep his people safe
- **Stay hidden** - Pristania still wants him dead

**Personal:**
- **Protect loved ones** - boyfriend, son, friends, Rajin
- **Find meaning** despite guilt
- **Live with his choices** - can't undo the past

**Impossible Dream:**
- **Undo killing Kami** - wishes he could take it back
- **Reunite the Kamigami with their mother** - doesn't know Rajin is her
- **End the cold war** - sees it as unreachable

---

**Hidden Relationship:**
- Has been in a secret relationship with Cristopher (Rachi) for 5 years
- Finds comfort and refuge in their intimacy
- Wants more than physical connection but Cristopher resists
- Only Lyzander knows about the relationship

### **Lingering Questions:**

**About Kami:**
- **Still thinks about him constantly**
- **Hasn't gotten over it** - 15+ years later, guilt remains
- **Questions if he was right** - ideology won, but at what cost?
- **Regrets it deeply** - wishes there had been another way

**About Himself:**
- **Why was he in the facility?** (Wonders about his origin)
- **What was the contingency?** (No clear answer, doesn't push)
- **Is Rajin hiding something?** (Suspects but doesn't confront)

**About the Future:**
- **Will Pristania attack again?**
- **Can peace last?**
- **Does he deserve happiness?** (Doubts it)

---

## **SECRETS & KNOWLEDGE**

### **What Meiji Knows:**
- Rajin and Kensuke raised him to oppose Kami
- He killed Kami in a duel (age 16)
- Pristania and Free are in cold war
- His psychokinesis is very powerful
- The contingency activated during the Kami fight
- Kami's children (the Kamigami) want him dead
- He's in a secret relationship with Cristopher (5 years)
- Cristopher struggles with their relationship (wants distance, Meiji wants closeness)

### **What Meiji Suspects:**
- **Rajin is hiding something** (correct - she's Megami)
- **His contingency has meaning** (correct - Ryakujin programming)
- **His origins are unusual** (correct - he's a weapon)
- But he doesn't push - afraid of the answers

### **What Meiji DOESN'T Know:**
- **He's a Ryakujin weapon** designed to kill Kami/Jashin
- **Rajin is Megami** (Kami's ex-wife, mother of the Kamigami)
- **The Kamigami are his step-siblings** (through Rajin)
- **His contingency is programming**, not natural ability
- **Arjan and Lopney exist** and are Kami's reincarnations
- **His beliefs were engineered** by Rajin/Kensuke for revenge

### **What the AUDIENCE Knows (That Meiji Doesn't):**
- His entire existence was designed to kill Kami
- His ideology, while genuine to him, was cultivated
- He's fighting for free will while being the ultimate puppet
- Meeting Arjan/Lopney will trigger his contingency (foreshadowing)
- His mother is Kami's widow (the irony is devastating)

---

## **THE TRUTH REVEAL**

### **When He Learns:**
- **During the final battle** (late story)
- **Fighting Perlereina** (who absorbed Kami's 40%)
- **Rajin tells him** before dying at Perlereina's hands

### **The Revelation:**
- He's a Ryakujin weapon
- Designed to kill Kami and Jashin
- His contingency is programming
- Rajin is Megami (Kami's ex-wife)
- Everything was connected from the start

### **His Reaction:**
- **Shock** - his entire understanding of himself shatters
- **Uses it to his advantage** - turns knowledge into power
- **Defines himself:** "I am Meiji the Free man, not tied to Ryakujin"
- **Chooses his identity** despite his origin

### **Does It Change His Ideology?**
- **No** - it **enforces** it
- Proves free will exists: He chose who to be despite programming
- His beliefs are validated by his choice to be himself
- **The ultimate irony:** A weapon proving humans have agency

---

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

### **What Meiji Represents:**

1. **The Counterpoint to Kami:**
   - Kami: Forced morality, authoritarianism
   - Meiji: Free will, acceptance of difference
   - Ideological clash defines the world

2. **The Tragedy of Unintended Consequences:**
   - Wanted to prove ideology
   - Killed a man, orphaned children, started a war
   - Victory became his greatest regret

3. **The Question of Free Will:**
   - Fights for human agency
   - But was designed, raised, and programmed
   - Does he have free will, or is he the ultimate puppet?
   - His arc suggests: **Choice exists even for those designed to act**

4. **Guilt and Redemption:**
   - Can someone who did terrible things (for good reasons) find peace?
   - Is redemption possible when you can't undo the harm?
   - Meiji's answer: No, but you keep trying anyway

---

### **Is His Ideology Right?**

**The Story's Answer:**
- **Yes, but...**
- Free will is essential (validated)
- But absolute freedom has costs (chaos, conflict)
- Just as Kami's absolute morality was tyranny
- Meiji's absolute freedom can be anarchy
- **The truth:** Neither extreme works alone

**But Meiji is MORE right than Kami:**
- Humans should choose
- Differences should be welcomed
- Forced righteousness defeats its own purpose
- Even if it leads to mistakes, choice matters

---

### **His Relationship to Arjan/Lopney:**

**When They Meet:**
- **His contingency will activate** (they carry Kami's power)
- **Foreshadowing:** Reveals their true nature
- **Meiji's confusion:** "Why is this happening again?"
- **Audience knows:** They're Kami's reincarnations

**His Reaction:**
- Likely **horrified** - more of Kami's legacy to haunt him
- **Protective instinct?** - they're innocents caught in this
- **Conflicted** - they represent what he destroyed

**Potential Arc:**
- Could become mentor/ally to them
- Teach them from his mistakes
- Help them avoid his path (guilt, isolation, regret)
- **Redemption through guidance?**

---
