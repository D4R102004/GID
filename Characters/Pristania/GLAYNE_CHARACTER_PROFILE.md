### **Core Values:**

### **After Gloria's Death:**
- Lost all hope initially
- Became obsessed with restraining emotions
- Trained relentlessly to become a Pristania Apostle
- Found new hope through Perlereina (his girlfriend)
- Channeled grief into devotion to Pristania's cause

### **Current State (Arc 1):**

- Playful and confident exterior, murderous interior
- Believes he's justified in everything he does

### **What Drives Him:**
- **Primary:** Revenge against Gallan (make him suffer, not kill him)
- **Secondary:** Pristania's mission (destroy Free, create Kami's perfect world)
- **Personal:** Pride in Byronstrike legacy, love for Perlereina

### **Fatal Flaws:**
- **Inability to forgive** - clings to rage despite having moved on in other ways
- **Refusal to let go** - won't accept that Gallan is seeking redemption

---

## **VOICE & DIALOGUE**

### **Speech Patterns:**
- **Sharp** but **jokingly childish** at times
- Very dark dialogue when serious
- Passionate and angry when triggered
- **Sarcastic** edge to most statements
- Completely different from Gallan's reserved speech

### **Verbal Tics:**
- **Laughs constantly** - "HAHAHA" / "HAHAHAHA"
- Uses laughter to punctuate threats
- References Gloria to justify actions
- Playful taunts mixed with malice

### **Sample Dialogue:**

**Hiring Yurisha (establishing contract):**
> "There's a job that needs your doing, Shinichi. It shouldn't be too difficult. Two birds, one knife wielder."
> *(Casual, almost bored, treats murder like a simple errand)*

**Killing Yurisha (eliminating loose end):**
> "You've failed. I'd say the bells toll for you now, assassin HAHAHA."
> *(Playful mockery before brutal execution)*

**Confronting Gallan (Arc 3 - the heart of his rage):**
> "So long, brother. Feeling remembrance? HAHAHAHAHA"
> *(Twisted nostalgia, mocking their shared past)*

### **Tone Shifts:**
- **With Perlereina:** Warm, affectionate, genuinely sweet
- **With Pristania allies:** Professional but friendly
- **With enemies:** Mocking, cruel, gleeful
- **About Gloria:** Grief bleeding through the playfulness
- **About Gallan:** Pure venom disguised as jokes

---

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Ellipse Manipulation**

**Core Ability:**
- **IDENTICAL to Arjan's power, but uses ellipses instead of spheres**
- Conjures energy ellipses from his hands
- Can spawn ellipses within 2-meter range
- Once created, ellipses can be manipulated at any distance
- Can control size, movement, placement, orientation
- Can detonate ellipses (controlled bursts, devastating damage)
- Can pre-place ellipses as traps
- No hard limit on number (veteran mastery)

**Advanced Techniques - What Glayne Already Knows:**
- **Ellipse Encapsulation** (same principle as Arjan's sphere encapsulation)
  - Traps objects/attacks, nullifies external power control
  - Uses this strategically in combat
- **Multi-layered detonations** (expertise Arjan will develop later)
- **Precision micro-ellipses** (for surgical strikes)
- **Massive ellipse barriers** (defensive formations)
- **Everything Arjan will learn throughout the story** - Glayne already mastered it

**Significance:**
- **Mirror to Arjan** - same power, opposite path
- Glayne is what Arjan COULD become if consumed by rage
- Represents Arjan's potential for darkness
- Thematic: identical tools, different purposes (creation vs. destruction)

---

### **Combat Style:**

**Philosophy:**
- **Constant pressure** - never gives opponents breathing room
- **Psychological dominance** - shows them how powerless they are
- **Enjoys fighting** - mirrors Arjan's potential love of combat
- Fights to prove superiority, not just to win

**Tactics:**
- Opens with overwhelming ellipse barrage
- Uses encapsulation to neutralize enemy abilities
- Layers traps throughout battlefield
- Detonates in calculated sequences to disorient
- **Plays with opponents** before finishing them
- Demonstrates every technique they can't counter

**Strengths:**
- Veteran mastery of his power (decades of experience)
- Understands every application of the ability
- Psychological warfare through dominance display
- Ruthless efficiency when he stops playing

**Weaknesses:**
- Can get carried away showing off (pride)
- Emotional when facing Gallan (fury affects judgment)
- Enjoys the fight too much (prolongs battles unnecessarily)

---

### **Yurisha's Execution:**

**Method:**
- Explodes **countless ellipses in Yurisha's eyes and around his body**
- Generates enough explosions to **burst him to pieces**
- Only thing remaining: **Yurisha's Jiang Shi hat covered in blood**

**What This Reveals:**
- **Brutality** - no mercy for failure
- **Precision** - surgical detonations despite seeming overkill
- **Message** - this is what happens to those who fail him
- **Efficiency disguised as cruelty** - makes it look sadistic but it's calculated
- Eliminates witness + sends warning to anyone else

---

### **VS. Gallan (Hypothetical - Happens Arc 3):**

**Matchup:**
- **Nearly even** - both are veteran fighters
- **Glayne has the edge** - more versatile applications of similar power
- **Gallan's counter:** Mental Erasure + experience
- **Glayne's advantage:** Raw offensive power, more refined techniques
- **Outcome:** Extremely difficult fight, Glayne would likely win
- **Emotional factor:** Glayne's rage vs. Gallan's guilt - both compromised

---

## **RELATIONSHIPS & HISTORY**

### **Gallan (His Brother - "The Traitor"):**

**Current View:**
- Thinks of him as **"my traitor brother"**
- Still remembers good times (shared childhood, their promise)
- Those memories only **fuel his rage** - "We had everything, and you threw it away"
- Would **NOT accept an apology** - too far gone for forgiveness
- **Wants Gallan to suffer, not die** - death would be mercy
- Still loves him somewhere deep down (complicates his hatred)

**The Betrayal (In Glayne's Mind):**
- Gallan chose Pristania over family
- Gallan wasn't there when Gloria died
- Gallan deserted Pristania (abandoned the cause)
- Gallan found peace and a new family (moved on while Gloria is still dead)

**The Pretense:**
- After Gloria's death, Glayne **pretended everything was okay** with Gallan
- Helped him, supported him, acted like a loving brother
- All while seething inside, planning, waiting

**What He'll Never Admit:**
- Part of him blames **himself** for not saving Gloria
- Part of him is **jealous** that Gallan got out and found peace
- Part of him **still wants his brother back** (buried deep)

---

### **Gloria Byronstrike (Their Mother):**

**How He Remembers Her:**
- **Fondly** - loving, caring mother to both children
- Sacrificed herself so they could eat
- Represented hope in their miserable life
- Her death = death of that hope

**His Guilt:**
- Feels guilty he couldn't save her
- Stopped working to care for her, but it wasn't enough
- Blames himself secondarily (but Gallan primarily)

**How He Uses Her Memory:**
- **Justification** for his revenge
- "I'm doing this for Gloria"
- "Gallan abandoned her, abandoned us"
- Her memory fuels both his grief and his rage

---

### **Perlereina Dei "Paru" (His Girlfriend):**

**Nature of Relationship:**
- **Dating** - romantic relationship
- She is one of the Kamigami (Kami's daughter, Pristania leadership)
- He serves as her Apostle (professional + personal relationship)
- Lives with her

**What She Represents:**
- **New hope** - he found light again after Gloria's death
- **Anchor** - keeps him functional despite his obsession
- **Genuine love** - he's silly, charming, caring with her
- **Proof he CAN move on** - ironic given he denies Gallan the same

**Dynamic:**
- He's completely different with her (warm, playful, loving)
- She likely doesn't know the full extent of his vendetta
- He compartmentalizes: revenge is separate from his life with her
- This shows he's not **entirely** consumed - he has balance (twisted as it is)

---

### **Diominiciel Dei (Brother-in-Law):**

**Relationship:**
- **Good terms** - they get along well
- Diominiciel is Perlereina's older brother
- Fellow Pristania leadership
- Likely shares ideological alignment

**Status:**
- Not isolated - has family connections through Perlereina
- Integrated into Pristania's upper ranks
- Respected among the Kamigami's circle

---

### **Pristania:**

**His Joining:**
- Joined **shortly after Gloria's death**
- Developed his powers **that same night** (grief awakening)
- Recruited by Pristania (similar to Gallan's path)
- **Hirohiko helped him** while he trained

**His Devotion:**
- **True believer** in Kami's cause
- Wants to destroy Free
- Wants to create the perfect world Kami envisioned
- Devoted Apostle serving Perlereina
- Does **NOT blame Pristania** for "stealing" Gallan
- Blames only Gallan for choosing to leave

**Current Role:**
- Apostle under Perlereina
- Likely high-ranking given his connection to the Kamigami
- Last heir of the Byronstrike family (takes great pride in this)

---

### **Arjan & Lopney (His Targets):**

**What They Represent:**
- **Gallan's new family** - the source of his "undeserved peace"
- **Replacements** for the family Gallan lost (Gloria, Glayne)
- **Symbols of Gallan's redemption** - which Glayne wants to destroy

**Why Target Them:**
- Not about the kids themselves - it's about **hurting Gallan**
- Wants Gallan to feel the **same loss** he felt
- Wants to deny Gallan his second chance (Gallan doesn't deserve redemption)
- "You left me alone. Now you'll be alone too."

**Does He Feel Guilt About This?**
- Likely justifies it: "They're obstacles to justice"
- Or: "Gallan brought this on them, not me"
- Compartmentalizes like he does with Perlereina

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- They're Kami's reincarnations
- Their true importance to the world
- That Gallan found them by chance (didn't "replace" anyone deliberately)

---

## **DISCOVERING THE ISLAND**

### **How He Found Gallan:**

**Method:**
- [TBD - "ties into the story, very complicated reason"]
- Found the island **recently** (not years of searching)
- This is a plot-relevant discovery with larger implications

**His Reaction:**
- **Disbelief** - thought Gallan was suffering in isolation
- **Rage** - Gallan has a **family**? A second chance?
- **Betrayal intensifies** - "He was supposed to be suffering"
- "He moved on. He replaced us. He gets to be happy while Gloria is dead?"

**Why Now:**
- Just found the island recently
- Planned the attack **very quickly** (impulsive rage)
- Hired Yurisha, set the plan in motion immediately
- No long, drawn-out scheme - this was reactive

---

## **ARC 1 ROLE**

### **His Appearance:**

**When:**
- **End of Arc 1** - appears personally
- After Yurisha fails to kill Arjan and Lopney

**Purpose:**
- **Kill Yurisha** - eliminate the loose end
- Ensure no trail leads back to him
- Send a message (though to whom? The kids? Gallan?)

**What He Does:**
- Executes Yurisha brutally (ellipse detonations)
- Leaves only the blood-covered Jiang Shi hat
- **Does NOT confront Gallan** (not yet)
- **Does NOT interact with Arjan/Lopney** (they don't meet him)
- Disappears after the execution

**What This Accomplishes:**
- Establishes him as a **credible, brutal threat**
- Plants seeds for future conflict
- Raises questions: Who is this? Why target the kids?
- **Mystery** for the protagonists (and audience if Glayne's identity is hidden initially)

---

### **What He Forces Into The Open:**

**For Arjan & Lopney:**
- Awareness that **someone wants them dead**
- Realization the island isn't safe
- Understanding there's a larger world of danger

**For Gallan:**
- **Fear for the kids' safety** - his worst nightmare realized
- Possibility that his past has caught up
- May suspect Pristania or his old enemies
- Doesn't know it's Glayne (yet?)

**Narrative Function:**
- **Inciting incident escalation** - Yurisha was just the weapon
- **True threat reveal** - the puppet master is worse
- **Stakes raised** - this isn't over

---

### **Does Gallan Know?**

**In Arc 1:**
- Unclear if Gallan realizes **Glayne** is behind this
- May recognize the **ellipse power** if he sees evidence
- May suspect but not confirm
- [Your call - does Gallan put it together, or is he in the dark until Arc 3?]

---

## **LONG-TERM ROLE**

### **Survival & Future:**
- **Survives Arc 1** - leaves after killing Yurisha
- Returns in **Arc 3** for direct confrontation with Gallan
- **Arc 5** - major challenge for Arjan and Lopney

### **Character Arc:**
- **Arc 1:** Shadow antagonist, establishes threat
- **Arc 3:** Direct confrontation with Gallan (emotional climax of their feud)
- **Arc 5:** Major battle against Arjan/Lopney (mirror fight - same power clash)
- **Endgame:** Redeemable but does not redeem himself

### **Redemption Question:**

**Is He Redeemable?**
- **Yes** - he's capable of love (Perlereina), has moved on in other ways
- He's not **pure evil** - he's **broken** and **unwilling to heal**

**Does He Redeem Himself?**
- **No** - stays hardcore Pristania devotee until death
- Feels **sorry** eventually (regret, not change)
- Chooses his path knowingly - tragic but not pitiable

**His End:**
- Dies as a Pristania Apostle
- Never reconciles with Gallan
- Accepts his fate but doesn't repent
- Tragic figure who **could have** chosen differently but didn't

---

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

### **What Glayne Represents:**

1. **The Cost of Gallan's Choices**
   - Living consequence of Gallan's decision to join Pristania
   - Proof that Gallan's sins have victims beyond himself
   - "You can't escape what you've done"

2. **The Challenge for Arjan & Lopney (Arc 5)**
   - **Mirror opponent** - same power, opposite path
   - Forces them to confront: "Could we become like him?"
   - Tests their philosophy vs. Pristania's ideology

3. **Grief Turned Poison**
   - Shows what happens when you refuse to heal
   - Contrast: Found love (Perlereina) but clings to hate (Gallan)
   - Could have moved on, **chose not to**

4. **Love Among "Bad People"**
   - Even antagonists can find genuine connection
   - Perlereina loves him, he loves her - this is **real**
   - Complicates the "villain" label - he's human, not a monster

---

### **Narrative Function:**

**Arc 1:**
- Raises stakes
- Drives protagonists off the island
- Establishes long-term threat

**Arc 3:**
- Emotional catharsis (Gallan vs. Glayne confrontation)
- Tests Gallan's redemption arc
- Explores themes of forgiveness and consequence

**Arc 5:**
- **Arjan's dark mirror** - what Arjan could become
- Ideological battle (Pristania devotion vs. Free will / personal choice)
- Physical battle (ellipse vs. sphere - same power, different users)

---

## **SECRETS & KNOWLEDGE**

### **What Glayne Knows:**
- Gallan deserted Pristania and lives in hiding
- Gallan has adopted two children (Arjan and Lopney)
- The island's location (recently discovered)
- How to use ellipse manipulation at veteran mastery

### **What Glayne Suspects:**
- Gallan is seeking redemption through the kids
- The kids might be important somehow (but doesn't know why)
- Gallan is hiding from his past

### **What Glayne DOESN'T Know:**
- Arjan and Lopney are Kami's reincarnations
- Arjan has the **same power** he does (spheres vs. ellipses)
- The beam of light that brought them
- Free's headquarters is on the same island
- The larger significance of the kids to the faction war

### **What He'll Learn Later:**
- [Arc 3+] Arjan has sphere manipulation
- [Arc 5?] The kids' true nature
- [Eventually] That his vendetta endangered something far bigger than he knew
