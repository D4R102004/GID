- Family bonds (haunted by losing Gloria)

### **Before the War (Young Gallan):**

- Fervent believer in Pristania and Kami
- Had his brother Glayne, his love interest, and purpose
- Idealistic and driven to help his family

### **After the War (Current Gallan):**

### **What Makes Him Happy:**

- Simple island life, training them, seeing them grow
- He HAS found some peace, but worries about their future

### **What Haunts Him:**
- His actions during the 3-Year War

> *(Concise, instructional, supportive)*

**Catching Lopney being reckless:**
> "Now there, that's enough. You needn't do that. Just flow. The situation will present itself."
> *(Gentle redirection, teacher's wisdom)*

**Alone with his guilt (internal):**
> "I couldn't... no I haven't done yet... It's just. I. It's I who's got the problem, not them."
> *(Fractured thoughts, self-blame, protecting the kids from his burden)*

### **Verbal Slips (Revealing His Past):**

- **Never says:** Pristania explicitly, any names from his past, specific war details
- **What he admits:** He's from Vista Alegre (true)
- **When pressed about the island:** "Wanted to live here. Nothing bad with it."

## **BACKSTORY - THE BYRONSTRIKE TRAGEDY**

### **The Byronstrike Family:**

**Original Members:**
- **Gloria Byronstrike:** Family heiress
- **Gerald:** Her husband
- **Glayne:** Their one-year-old son

**The Family's Fall:**
- Enormous manor in Vista Alegre
- Family money squandered over generations
- Left with nothing but the estate

**Gallan's Arrival:**
- Found as a baby in a basket in the garbage
- Gloria picked him up, named him Gallan
- **Gerald's response:** Suggested returning Gallan to the dump (couldn't feed another mouth)
- **Gloria's response:** Argued against it
- **Result:** Gerald left the house

**Growing Up:**
- Gloria raised both Gallan and Glayne
- They developed a bond as brothers
- Both worked from a very young age
- **Shared promise:** Get the family out of poverty together

**Gallan's Thievery:**
- Developed his Mental Erasure powers as a child
- Used them for stealing to support the family
- Made the family "a bit more stable"

---

### **The Hirohiko Encounter:**

**The Theft Attempt:**
- Gallan tried to steal from **Hirohiko (Gyrus)**, one of Pristania's Kamigami
- Hirohiko caught him in the act

**The Offer:**
- Hirohiko DIDN'T punish him
- Instead: Invited Gallan into a Pristania training course
- Goal: Better utilize his powers, become a future member
- **Gallan's perspective:** Saw this as an opportunity to help his family

**The Departure:**
- Gallan left for Pristania training
- Left Glayne to take care of Gloria

---

### **The Tragedy:**

**While Gallan Was Away:**
- Gallan's help was MUCH needed at home
- Without him, Gloria stopped eating so Glayne could eat
- Gloria fell ill from malnutrition
- Glayne had to stop working to care for her
- Both suffered hunger
- **Gloria's disease:** Curable, but the family had no money for a doctor

**Gallan's Training:**
- Passed all exams with top grades
- Trained harder than anyone to become a top Pristania member
- Reached the final stage: Use his powers in front of Kami himself

**The Night Everything Fell Apart:**

**Gallan's Final Exam:**
- Had to demonstrate his ability before Kami
- Remained concealed (invisible) during the test

**Gloria's Condition:**
- At her darkest point the same night
- Glayne tried to call Gallan to tell him their mother was dying
- **Gallan couldn't answer:** He was using his powers, invisible, unreachable

**The Aftermath:**
- Gallan was accepted as Hirohiko's Apostle
- Raced home when he saw the missed calls
- **Arrived 10 minutes too late**
- Glayne met him at the door, tears in his eyes
- Gloria had just passed away

---

### **The Guilt:**
- Gallan blames himself entirely
- If he'd answered the phone, he could've helped
- If he'd stayed home instead of chasing Pristania, she'd be alive
- His success (becoming an Apostle) is forever tainted by this failure

---

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Mental Erasure**

**Mechanics:**
- Erases himself (or others) from a target's perception
- Affects sight AND sound (complete invisibility)
- Can be maintained passively once activated
- **Has an activation moment** - people can notice when he's doing it (visual shimmer? Sound cue?)
- Functionally: Makes him intangible to detection

**Extended Uses:**
- Conceals the island itself (people passing by don't register it exists)
- Used for thievery as a child
- Used for infiltration/assassination during the war
- Mainland trips: No one remembers him after he leaves

### **Combat Style:**

**Philosophy:**
- **Hit and run** tactics
- Uses invisibility for positioning and escape
- Attrition-based fighter (wears opponents down)
- **Not a brawler:** Prefers efficiency over force

**Martial Arts:**
- Practices standard martial arts of the world *[worldbuilding TBD]*
- Taught Lopney everything he knows
- Skilled but not flashy

**Why He Doesn't Use Powers Against Lopney:**
- **Stated reason:** "Wants to fight on equal terms"
- **Real reason:** He enjoys fighting her, finds it fun
- Knows his powers give overwhelming advantage
- Values the pure martial contest

### **Combat Philosophy:**
- Still believes in Kami's ideals (justice, helping others)
- Understands the world is grey (no pure good/evil)
- Hates Free but not consumed by revenge
- Pragmatic survivor, not ideologue

---

## **RELATIONSHIPS**

### **Arjan:**

**Why He Loves Him:**
- Reminds him of both **Glayne** (his brother) and **Kami** (his idol)
- Pure heart, selfless protector energy
- Represents the best of what Gallan once believed in

**How He Treats Him:**
- Caring and supportive
- Strict during training but gentle otherwise
- Spoils him with small joys (sweets, moments of peace)

**What He Fears:**
- Arjan's naivety will lead to terrible mistakes
- The world will crush his idealism (like it crushed Gallan's)
- Arjan will have to make the same impossible choices Gallan did

**Does NOT remind him of:** His younger self

---

### **Lopney:**

**Why He Loves Her:**
- Reminds him of **his love interest** *[Name TBD - to be developed later]*
- Her drive, intelligence, fighting spirit
- She's earned every bit of skill through hard work

**How He Treats Her:**
- Strict teacher - pushes her harder than Arjan
- Refuses to use powers against her (wants pure martial contest)
- Spoils her too, but with different gestures (books? Tools? TBD)

**Training Triggers Guilt:**
- Sparring with her reminds him of his lost love
- Her determination echoes someone he couldn't save

**Does He Know She Suspects Him?**
- **No.** He's oblivious to her suspicions
- Assumes she trusts him fully like Arjan does

**Her Drive to Leave:**
- Terrifies him - means he has to let them go someday
- Forcing him to confront his past mistakes
- Knows he can't keep them isolated forever

---

### **The Kids as a Whole:**

**What They Represent:**
- **Redemption** - a second chance to do right
- **Everything** - his entire new life revolves around them
- **Purpose** - raising them gives meaning to his survival

**How He Raises Them:**
- **Hides them from the world** (knows it's unstable, Pristania/Free tension)
- **Doesn't fear corrupting them** - believes he's protecting them
- **Educates them:** Tells them about Kami and Meiji, Pristania and Free
- **Kami's ideology:** Teaches them the principles but doesn't make them fanatics
- **About Meiji:** "He's an asshole" (biased but not rabid)

**His Fear:**
- The kids being dragged into the war
- Them discovering his past and hating him
- Failing them like he failed Gloria

---

### **Hirohiko (Gyrus) - His Master:**

**What Hirohiko Means to Him:**

- Gave him purpose, structure, belonging
- Treated him like a valued protege, not a tool

**Current Belief (FALSE):**
- Gallan was **told** that Hirohiko left Pristania
- Believes his master abandoned the organization
- Feels remorse that Hirohiko left without telling him

**The Truth:**
- Hirohiko did NOT leave Pristania *[backstory TBD]*
- Gallan doesn't know this

**Does Hirohiko Search for Him?**
- **No.** *[Reason TBD - does Hirohiko think Gallan is dead? Does he respect his choice to leave?]*

**If They Meet Again:**
- Gallan would say: **"Master..."**
- Would give him a hug
- Likely break down emotionally
- *[This reunion needs to be DEVASTATING when it happens]*

---

### **Glayne (His Brother):**

**Current Status:** *[TBD - alive? Dead? Estranged?]*

**Gallan's Feelings:**
- Guilt for leaving him to care for Gloria alone
- Guilt for not being there when she died
- Does he still think about Glayne? Try to contact him?
- *[Needs development for potential later story beats]*

---

### **His Love Interest:**

**Status:** *[TBD - who was she? What happened to her?]*
**Connection to Lopney:** She reminds him of this person
**Why It Matters:** Training Lopney triggers grief/guilt tied to this loss
*[Needs full development]*

---

## **THE ISLAND & ISOLATION**

### **Why This Island:**
- **Pure chance** - searched for a distant, isolated island
- Had no knowledge of Free HQ
- Just wanted to disappear from the world

### **Free HQ Arrival:**
- Free built their headquarters on the island **5 years ago**
- Gallan was already living there with the kids
- **Neither side noticed the other** (Gallan's Mental Erasure conceals his presence)

### **Finding Arjan and Lopney:**

**The Discovery:**

- **First reaction:** Surprise

**Did He Recognize Them as Supernatural?**
- **Not immediately**

- Never found traces of who brought them

**Why Did He Take Them?**
- Couldn't leave babies to starve in the forest
- Saw it as a sign (second chance after Gloria)
- No grand plan, just human decency

**What He Knows About Their Origins:**
- **Nothing.** Completely in the dark
- Doesn't know they're Kami's reincarnations
- Doesn't know about the beam of light

- "I'm going out" (doesn't hide it, but doesn't elaborate)

- No one remembers him after transactions

**Does He Ever Want to Leave Permanently?**
- **No.** Never thinks about abandoning the island or the kids
- They're his purpose now

---

- His Pristania past (Apostle status, rank, service)
- His brother Glayne

- *[His role in later arcs TBD]*

---

## **MANIFESTATIONS OF GUILT**

### **Physical:**
- Forces his knuckles together when stressed
- Never explosive or outwardly angry
- Reserved, internalized suffering

### **Nightmares:**
- Frequent (Arjan and Lopney notice)
- They hear him at night but can't understand the meaning
- War flashbacks? Gloria's death? Both?

### **Training Triggers:**
- **With Lopney:** Reminds him of his love interest (grief surfaces)
- **With Arjan:** Reminds him of Glayne and Kami (regret for choices made)

### **Daily Life:**
- Goes through motions peacefully
- Found some measure of peace
- But knows it's temporary (kids will leave, past will catch up)

---

## **WRITING GALLAN - QUICK REFERENCE**

### **Dialogue Do's:**
✅ Speak concisely - only what's necessary
✅ Gentle but firm teacher voice
✅ Tone of unworthiness when talking about himself
✅ Catches himself mid-sentence when referencing past
✅ Vague deflections when pressed ("my brother," "back in my days")

### **Dialogue Don'ts:**
❌ Never says "Pristania" explicitly
❌ Never mentions names from his past
❌ No grand speeches (he's reserved)
❌ Doesn't overshare emotions (internalizes guilt)

### **Action Beats:**
✅ Forces knuckles when guilty/stressed
✅ Strikes caring smiles despite stern expression
✅ Organizational mannerisms (stands at attention, disciplined movements)
✅ Spoils kids with sweets
✅ Gives NO tells when hiding secrets (crucial!)

### **Internal Thoughts:**
✅ Constant awareness of his unworthiness
✅ Fear of the kids discovering the truth
✅ Memories of Gloria's death
✅ Wondering about Hirohiko
✅ Dread of the inevitable confrontation with his past

---

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

Gallan represents **redemption through love, haunted by the past:**
- His guilt is his driving force AND his prison
- He can give the kids a peaceful life, but can't escape what he's done
- His arc asks: **Can love redeem a killer? Can peace atone for war?**
- The kids are his second chance - but second chances don't erase first sins

He's the **moral complexity** of the story - proof that good people do terrible things in war, and that healing is possible but never complete.

---

## **OPEN QUESTIONS FOR LATER DEVELOPMENT:**

1. **Glayne's current status:** Alive? Dead? Estranged? Role in story?
2. **Gallan's love interest:** Who was she? What happened to her? Why does Lopney remind him of her?
3. **Hirohiko's truth:** What actually happened? Why does Gallan think he left Pristania?
4. **The scar location:** Where exactly is Gallan's war mark/scar?
5. **Reunion scenes:** Gallan + Hirohiko? Gallan + Glayne? Gallan + his past?
