- "That's a blow to my **kokoro**" (heart/feelings)

- Likely sprinkles in other Japanese words casually

### **Sample Dialogue:**

**First appearance (ready to begin the hunt):**
> "My, isn't it time I got on with the fun?"
> *(Casual, excited, like he's about to play a game)*

**Mid-combat with Lopney (mocking her):**
> "Very not pretty on your part, silly girl."
> *(Condescending, sarcastic, treating combat like a performance critique)*

**Revealing his "cultured killer" philosophy:**
> "I couldn't believe you couldn't read that. Hasn't your father taught you how important it is to read?"
> *(Genuine shock that someone is illiterate, mixed with mockery)*

### **Verbal Habits:**
- Constantly comments on the fight like a spectator
- Makes literary/kanji references mid-combat
- Talks to himself when alone (internal monologue out loud)
- Uses overly formal/archaic phrasing mixed with modern slang

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Paper Manipulation**

**Core Ability:**
- Complete control over pieces of paper
- Can manipulate multiple sheets simultaneously
- Range: [TBD - probably line of sight or within certain distance]

**Combat Applications:**

1. **Hardening (刃 - "blade"):**
   - Hardens paper to knife-like sharpness
   - Uses as thrown projectiles
   - Can cut through flesh and light armor
   - Writes **刃** (blade) on these papers (not necessary, but he enjoys it)

2. **Envelopment/Mummification (Ultimate Technique):**
   - Grabs opponent's hand
   - Papers rapidly envelop entire body
   - Mummifies them completely, immobilizing them
   - Potentially suffocating if maintained
   - **This is his finishing move**

3. **Barriers:**
   - Can block doors, windows, passages with reinforced paper
   - Creates paper walls for defense or trapping opponents
   - Uses paper to control battlefield layout

4. **Kanji Aesthetics:**
   - Writes different kanji on papers based on their purpose
   - **刃** (blade) for cutting papers
   - Other kanji for other effects (aesthetic, not mechanical requirement)
   - "Killing requires culture" - even his powers must be artistic

**Limitations:**
- Papers must remain under his control (active concentration)
- Can be countered by:
  - **Arjan's Sphere Encapsulation** (nullifies his control over trapped papers)
  - **Lopney's Nullification** (cancels his control entirely)
- Once a paper is removed from his control, it's just normal paper again

---

### **Fighting Style:**

**Philosophy:**
- **Harassment and evasion** - constant pressure, never lets up
- Avoids direct confrontation - he's not a brawler
- Wears opponents down mentally and physically
- Makes combat a performance (for his own entertainment)

**Tactics:**
- Opens with paper projectiles to test defenses
- Mocks and distracts opponents verbally while attacking
- Uses papers to control space, limit movement options
- Goes for mummification finish when opponent is exhausted/distracted
- **Plays with his food** - drags out kills for entertainment

**Strengths:**
- Versatile ability (offense, defense, control)
- Psychological warfare (constant mockery breaks concentration)
- Knowledge of weak points (professional assassin training)
- Creativity in applying his power

**Weaknesses:**
- **Low physical durability** - can be overpowered easily if hit
- **Overconfidence** - underestimates opponents, doesn't calculate well
- **Gets carried away** - enjoyment leads to mistakes
- **Loses control of encapsulated/nullified papers** - can't adapt quickly

---

### **Why He Was Hired:**

**Official Reason:**
- He was **available** at the time Glayne needed someone
- Professional assassin with a successful track record
- Discrete operator (prefers shadows)

**Real Reason:**
- Expendable - Glayne plans to kill him afterwards anyway
- Skilled enough to potentially succeed
- No connections to Pristania/Free that would raise flags
- Won't ask too many questions if paid well

---

## **ROLE IN ARC 1**

### **The Contract:**

**Employer:** Glayne Byronstrike (Gallan's brother)

**Target:** Arjan and Lopney (kill both)

**Motivation (Glayne's):**
- Revenge against Gallan for:
  - Deserting Pristania
  - Abandoning the family (leading to Gloria's death)
- Wants Gallan to suffer by losing his new family
- Wants Gallan to be **alone in his redemption** - no second chance

**Yurisha's Instructions:**
- Kill the children
- Reveal nothing about who hired him
- Make it look like a random attack (if possible)

**Yurisha's Secret Agenda:**
- Curious about why Glayne is so obsessed with these kids
- Wants to extract information from them to use as leverage against Glayne
- Plans to coerce Glayne for more money if he finds useful secrets
- Views his targets with "personal interest" because of their connection to an ex-Pristania Apostle

---

### **Discovery of the Island:**

**How He Found It:**
- Tipped off by Glayne (who discovered it through *[later plot development]*)
- Glayne provides exact location, breaking through Gallan's concealment

**Arrival:**
- Arrives alone (solo operator)
- Uses his paper manipulation to infiltrate quietly
- Observes the family before striking
- Chooses his moment when he thinks he has the advantage

---

### **Combat Encounters:**

**VS. Arjan:**
- Arjan discovers **Sphere Encapsulation** mid-fight
- Trapping Yurisha's papers in spheres nullifies his control
- This catches Yurisha off-guard (didn't calculate this possibility)
- Yurisha is excited by the challenge but frustrated by the counter

**VS. Lopney:**
- Mocks her relentlessly ("silly girl," comments on her fighting)
- Her nullification ability can disrupt his papers when active
- Underestimates her martial prowess (she's "just a girl with no powers")
- Her determination and skill frustrate his attempts to toy with her

**VS. Gallan:**
- If they fight, Gallan would have the edge
- Gallan's experience + Mental Erasure counters Yurisha's style
- Yurisha would recognize Gallan as a serious threat (ex-Apostle)

**Overall Arc 1 Performance:**
- Dangerous and competent initially
- Underestimation and overconfidence lead to mistakes
- Gets carried away enjoying the hunt
- **Fails to kill either Arjan or Lopney**

---

### **Truth He Reveals:**

**What He Exposes:**
- There IS someone behind the attack on Arjan and Lopney
- Someone wants them dead specifically (not random)
- Hints that this is connected to Gallan's past

**What He DOESN'T Reveal:**
- Glayne's identity (under strict orders)
- Why Glayne wants the kids dead
- Gallan's history with Pristania (doesn't know details himself)
- The kids' true nature (doesn't know about Kami connection)

**What He Discovers:**
- **Arjan looks similar to Kami in appearance**
- Mentions this casually, finds it curious but doesn't connect the dots
- This plants a seed for the audience/Gallan

---

### **His Death:**

**Circumstances:**

**Method:**
- **Gruesome death** at Glayne's hands
- [Specific method TBD based on Glayne's powers/approach]
- Serves as a statement: Glayne is willing to go this far

**Narrative Function:**
- Shows Glayne's ruthlessness
- Eliminates witness to his vendetta
- Demonstrates the stakes (even a skilled assassin dies horribly)
- Leaves no trail back to Glayne

**Yurisha's Perspective:**

---

---

### **Arjan, Lopney, Gallan (Targets):**

**Yurisha's View:**

- Gallan: Recognizes as ex-Pristania, cautious respect for his skill

**Their View of Yurisha:**

---

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

### **What Yurisha Represents:**
- **The past catching up** - Gallan's old life invading the island sanctuary
- **The outside world's darkness** - not everyone is as pure as the kids
- **Stakes escalation** - this is real, people want them dead
- **False security shattered** - the island was never truly safe

### **Why an Assassin (Not a Soldier)?**
- Mirrors Gallan's past sins (he killed for Pristania)
- Represents the dark side of "professionalism" (killing as craft)
- Shows that war's brutality extends beyond battlefields
- Glayne's choice of weapon reflects his cowardice (won't face Gallan directly)

### **His Cultural Obsession:**
- Contrasts with the story's themes of **what makes killing justified**
- He dresses it up as art, but it's still murder
- "Killing requires culture" is a sick justification
- Forces characters to confront: Is there a "right way" to kill?
