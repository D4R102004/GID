- **Gallan didn't know about disappearance** - Dyoni and Paru told him "Gyrus left"

### **During the 3-Year War:**

**Initial Response:**
- **Devastated by Kami's death** - "as if his world collapsed"
- Went into war seeking revenge initially

## **POWERS & COMBAT**

### **Nouryoku: Inverse World Manipulation**

**Nickname:** Gyrus

---

### **The Inverse World - Description:**

**What It Is:**
- A marvelous parallel dimension
- **Time doesn't flow** inside it
- **Space is unstable** - platforms float, ground shifts
- Dark place with floating platforms
- Can walk on walls and water (physics reversed)
- Rocks and trees grow from ground then disappear
- **No animals** - empty, eerie dimension

**Mirror Property:**
- **Mirrors the real world** in a distorted way
- River in real world = river in Inverse World
- Building in real world = building in Inverse World (but appearance changes)
- Functions as **dark mirror of existing objects**
- Geography corresponds but aesthetics warp

---

### **Power Mechanics:**

**Portal Creation:**
- Can open portals leading into and out of Inverse World
- Entry and exit points can be different locations
- Example: Enter portal in one city, walk through Inverse World, exit portal in another city

**Personal Access:**
- Can enter Inverse World through portal
- Walks unharmed within it (knows it intimately)
- Exits through another portal to different part of real world
- **Teleportation via dimensional travel**

**Dragging Others:**
- Can pull people into Inverse World
- **Limitation:** While another person is inside, **he cannot leave**
- Can trap himself with someone in Inverse World
- Must remain until other person exits or is released
- Strategic trade-off: containment vs. mobility

---

### **Combat Applications (Pre-Amnesia):**

**Fighting Style:**
- **Sneaky and trolling** - psychological warfare
- Gets into Inverse World to avoid harm
- Thinks situations through while dimension-hopping
- Appears somewhere else, takes enemies by surprise
- **Skilled martial artist** (not as much as Perlereina, but competent)

**Tactics:**
- Dodge attacks by entering Inverse World
- Analyze opponents while they're confused
- Exit behind/beside them for surprise strikes
- Drag enemies into Inverse World to disorient them
- Fight on his terms (knows the terrain better than anyone)
- Use unstable space to advantage (walk on walls, water)

**Strategic Use:**
- Escape from dangerous situations
- Infiltration (bypass defenses via parallel dimension)
- Ambush tactics (unexpected positioning)
- Containment (trap dangerous enemies with him)

---

### **Current Status (Post-Amnesia):**

**Lost Powers:**
- **Cannot access Inverse World** - doesn't remember having this ability
- Memories of combat techniques gone
- Martial arts skills dormant

**Retained Power (via Jashin):**
- Can summon **one healing spear** (Jashin's gift)
- Uses this as doctor's "medicine"
- Patients eat piece of spear, wounds restore
- Nutritious and regenerative

---

### **Jashin's Healing Spear:**

**Discovery:**
- **Jashin developed this during his sealed years**
- Experimented with his God's Halberd ability
- Created spear variant with healing properties
- When eaten: Restores wounds, provides nutrition

**How Gyrus Got It:**
- Jashin gave him this power when awakening his consciousness
- **How Gyrus survived journey** from Pristania to Kamino ruins
- Didn't starve during long walk (ate healing spears)
- Became foundation of his doctor identity

**Medical Application:**
- Summons spear, breaks off piece
- Patient eats it (tastes like...? TBD)
- Wound heals rapidly
- No one knows it's a Nouryoku - thinks it's special medicine
- Called "Dr. Hero" by kids for miraculous healing

---

### **Power Restoration (Arc 4 End):**

**When Memories Return:**
- **Regains Inverse World powers fully**
- Combat techniques come back
- Knows his world intimately again

**Enhanced by Jashin:**
- Jashin grants him access to more of his abilities
- Can use God's Halberd powers (not just healing spear)
- Fighting Diominiciel (Arc 5) with boosted capabilities
- **Jashin empowers him strategically** for his own goals

---

## **THE THREE-WAY CONFRONTATION**

### **The Ideological Split:**

**Hirohiko's Stance:**
- **Kami's morality excluded vengeance**
- Father preached righteousness and doing the right thing
- Being a good person, not a violent avenger
- **"Kami would've accepted he lost the duel fair and square if he had lost"**
- Kami never actively hunted detractors
- **Kami convinced others, not coerced them through violence**

**His Approach:**
- Tried to convince siblings peacefully first
- Even though they disagreed, pressed forward with peace
- Alongside Gallan and other high-ranking Pristania members, **ended the war**
- Relationship with siblings grew bitter after treaty

---

### **The Final Straw - The Quarrel:**

**Setting:**
- Quarrel with Perlereina
- Diominiciel observing

**What Was Said:**
- **Gyrus:** "Father wouldn't have wanted Pristania to be remembered as a bastion of violence."
- **Perlereina:** "Meiji and Free and all who opposed them deserved death."
- Escalated into shouting match
- **Perlereina struck first** - physical violence erupted
- Hirohiko fought back
- Diominiciel intervened

**The Accident:**
- **Hirohiko created portal** to Inverse World
- **Perlereina created portal** in same spot simultaneously
- **Both portals distorted** - spatial collision
- **Diominiciel was slowing time** during confrontation
- **Gyrus passed through distorted portal while time slowed**
- Catastrophic interaction: Space + Time + Dimensional rupture

**The Impact:**
- Wiped out his memories completely
- Put him in coma-like state
- Severe brain damage
- **Abrupt** - no last words, no warning

---

### **The Coma State:**

**Condition:**
- Alive and conscious but **wouldn't speak or spoke nonsense**
- Mind damaged, memories gone
- Didn't recognize siblings
- **Akin to madness** - autism-like state, insanity
- Lasted for years

**The Imprisonment:**
- Siblings kept him in **secret room within Pristania HQ**
- Accessible only by Diominiciel and Perlereina
- Hidden from all other Pristania members

**The Secret Room Location:**

**Jashin's Body Context:**
- Kami hid Jashin's comatose body in Pristania HQ
- Behind a wall in what appeared to be storage room
- Room crammed with things to hide the wall's secret
- Jashin's chamber went unnoticed

**Gyrus's Imprisonment:**
- Diominiciel and Perlereina sought similar concealment
- **Vacated the old storage room**
- Created new storage room elsewhere
- **Used old storage room to store Hirohiko**
- Room directly next to Jashin's hidden chamber

---

### **Diominiciel's Efforts:**

**Visits:**
- Diominiciel visited Gyrus regularly
- Researching way to undo his state
- Working on memory restoration

**Recordings:**
- **Both Diominiciel and Perlereina recorded themselves**
- Apologizing to Gyrus
- Saying how much they loved him
- Played recordings to him hoping to awaken memories
- **Gyrus wouldn't feel anything** - remained in autistic/insane state

**Perlereina's Guilt:**
- Didn't visit (too painful)
- But felt deeply guilty
- Participated in recordings despite not seeing him

**Before Solution:**
- Diominiciel hadn't reached solution yet
- Gyrus escaped before cure was found

---

## **JASHIN'S INTERVENTION**

### **Jashin's Awakening:**

**After Kami's Death:**
- Kami's power fragmented (30% Arjan, 30% Lopney, 40% corpse)
- Seal did NOT fully break (power still exists in fragments)
- **Jashin's consciousness partially returned to his body**
- Still couldn't move or speak (remains sealed while Kami's powers exist)
- **But could influence his surroundings**

**Discovery:**
- Jashin noticed Gyrus in room next to his
- Sensed his damaged mind, his imprisonment
- Saw opportunity

---

### **The Transfer:**

**Process:**
- **Jashin transferred his consciousness from his body into Gyrus**
- Process took as long as the coma (years)
- Slow, gradual merging with Gyrus's damaged mind

**Jashin's Body:**
- **Original comatose body remains behind the wall**
- Hidden in Pristania HQ
- Alive but **without consciousness** now
- Still sealed (cannot move/speak)

**Gyrus as Vessel:**
- Jashin now resides in Gyrus's subconscious
- Observes through his senses
- Can influence thoughts, dreams, actions
- Took control of body for escape

---

### **The Escape:**

**Jashin's Plan:**
- Saw opportunity to walk the world again (albeit in different body)
- **Possessed Gyrus's body** - took full control
- Escaped Pristania HQ unnoticed
- **No one knew Gyrus was imprisoned** except Dyoni and Paru
- They were terrified when they noticed he was gone

**The Journey:**
- Jashin led Gyrus all the way from Pristania to near Kamino
- **Destination:** Ruins of Ryakujin facility (Jashin's original home)
- Jashin knew no one would find him there
- During journey: Jashin fed Gyrus healing spears (so he wouldn't starve)

**Awakening Gyrus:**
- Once at ruins, **Jashin awakened Gyrus's consciousness**
- Gyrus's first memory: Waking up in the ruins
- Jashin gave him partial access to powers (healing spear)
- **Black eye surroundings appeared** - physical manifestation of Jashin within

**After Escape:**
- Luckily for Diominiciel and Perlereina, Gyrus went far
- New look (black eye surroundings) made him unrecognizable
- Told everyone Gyrus had "left" Pristania (cover story maintained)

---

### **Jashin's Current Role:**

**His Presence:**
- Resides in Gyrus's subconscious
- Observing and protective from within
- **Grows to care about Gyrus deeply** - sees kinship (both "betrayed" by siblings)

**His Influence:**
- Can communicate with Gyrus mentally (Gyrus thinks it's his own thoughts)
- Influences dreams
- Plants ideas in Gyrus's head
- Occasionally takes full control of body

**Control Mechanism:**
- When Jashin takes control: **Gyrus enters trance**
- **Gyrus doesn't remember anything afterwards**
- Wakes up with lost time, no memory of what happened
- While possessed: Jashin can use **all of his abilities** (God's Halberd, flight, etc.)

**Gyrus's Awareness:**
- **Completely unaware of Jashin's presence**
- Doesn't know he's possessed
- Thinks he's alone in his mind
- Attributes strange urges to his own intuition

---

### **Jashin's Goals:**

**Throughout the Story:**
- Guides Gyrus subconsciously toward his goals
- Manipulates events from within
- **Looming presence** working through Gyrus
- Foreshadowed constantly but hidden

**Examples of Manipulation:**
- **Arc 3:** Senses Lopney near coast, plants thought: "Maybe I should go to the beach" - Gyrus meets protagonists
- **Arc 4 end:** Guides Gyrus to join Free
- **Arc 5:** Gives Gyrus memories when time is right, empowers him with abilities for fighting Diominiciel

**Long-Term Plan:**
- Waiting for Kami's power to be fully destroyed
- **Arc 5 end:** Arjan and Lopney consume Kami's 40% power, use resurrections, **Kami's power wiped out for good**
- **Seal breaks completely**
- **Arc 6:** Jashin fully becomes free, confronts Gyrus directly
- **Final antagonist reveal**

---

## **THEMATIC ROLE**

### **What Hirohiko/Gyrus Represents:**

1. **The Kamigami Who Remained Closest to Kami:**
   - Understood father's teachings correctly
   - Internalized morality, not just ideology
   - Applied it even when painful (opposing siblings)

2. **Love:**
   - Loved family deeply, even when they opposed him
   - Would forgive them (the accident wasn't malicious)
   - Love transcends ideological splits

3. **Doing the Right Thing Despite Vengeance:**
   - Saw war's horrors, turned against revenge
   - Engineered peace while siblings wanted blood
   - Stood alone for his principles

4. **Redemption:**
   - Redeemed during war (saw truth, changed course)
   - Never really a villain
   - Always right, just misunderstood by siblings

5. **Survival Through Integrity:**
   - **Symbolism:** He survives because he didn't fall to revenge
   - Siblings died consumed by hatred
   - He lived because he stayed true

6. **The Ultimate Irony:**
   - Fights for free will and doing right thing
   - **Unknowingly manipulated by Jashin throughout**
   - Puppet fighting for agency
   - Final arc: Can he act truly freely after revelation?

---

### **Contrast with His Siblings:**

**Perlereina:**
- Blind fanaticism vs. his understanding
- Vengeance vs. his peace
- Corrupted Kami's teachings vs. preserved them
- Died consumed by hate vs. survived through love

**Diominiciel:**
- Pragmatic justification vs. his moral clarity
- Enabled Perlereina vs. opposed them both
- Internal conflict unresolved vs. stood firm in beliefs
- Died for revenge vs. survived for reconciliation

**Together:**
- They lost their way, he stayed true
- They couldn't forgive, he would have
- They died, he lived
- He inherits responsibility to fix what they broke

---

### **The Jashin Twist:**

**Tragic Irony:**
- Thinks he's acting independently
- Actually guided by ancient god
- Fights for right thing while being manipulated
- **Free will questioned throughout his arc**

**Foreshadowing:**
- Black eye surroundings (visual cue)
- Convenient coincidences (guided to protagonists)
- Dreams and urges (Jashin planting ideas)
- Enhanced powers when needed (Jashin's gifts)
- Looming presence readers can sense

**Final Revelation:**
- Everything clicks into place (Arc 6)
- Gyrus must confront: Was ANY of it his choice?
- Ultimate test: Acting freely after learning the truth

---

**After Disappearance:**
- Dyoni and Paru told Gallan "Gyrus left"

### **Jashin (The Hidden Presence):**

**Jashin's Perspective:**
- **Grows to care about Gyrus deeply**
- Sees kinship: Both "betrayed" by siblings
- Protective from within
- But also using him for own goals
- Complex relationship: Care + manipulation

**Gyrus's Awareness:**
- **Completely unaware** Jashin exists within him
- Doesn't know he's possessed
- Attributes urges/dreams to his own mind
- **Arc 6:** Learns the truth, confronts Jashin

**Dynamic:**
- Parasite/host
- Manipulator/puppet
- Protector/prisoner
- All at once

### **Meiji (Father's Killer):**

**Pre-Amnesia:**
- Opposed vengeance against him
